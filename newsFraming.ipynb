       "  'full_article': ' Neon Esports came back roaring from a series opening loss to trample on T1, 2-1, in the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC)-Southeast Asia Upper Division tiebreaker for the Singapore Major group stage spot on Saturday night, Feb. 27. With its back against the wall after the Game 1 defeat, Neon went to the deadly duo of 10K MMR midlaner Erin Jasper “Yopaj” Ferrer’s Void Spirit and 11K MMR carry John Anthony “Natsumi-” Vargas’ Io to score a 40-13 victory in 47 minutes in Game 2. Yopaj slashed his way to 20 kills and 14 assists against four deaths while Natsumi finished with 10 kills and 18 assists with only a single death. Neon then unleashed a “dual carry” lineup in the winner-take-all Game 3 featuring the Razor of Natsumi and Wraith King of Andrei “debil_2000” Ong (also known as “Skem”), who played as the offlaner in this crucial series. Yopaj’s Queen of Pain, position-4 support Prieme “PlayHard” Maque’s Lina and position-5 Jaunuel “Jaunuel” Arcilla’s Disruptor were equally impressive as Neon showed its signature aggression to obliterate T1, 36-8, in 43 minutes. With the come-from-behind series win, Neon clinched a spot in the group stage of the first Dota 2 Major tournament of 2021 which will be hosted by ONE Esports and PGL on March 27 to April 4. T1, which suffered from an unlikely lackluster performance by veteran Filipino offlaner Carlo “Kuku” Palad, settled for a seat in the Major wild card phase where it is set to face the TI7 winning team Nigma (formerly Team Liquid) and possibly the two-time TI champion OG. Kuku went on a combined record of zero kills and 26 deaths in Games 2 and 3. He was 0-16 on his Venomancer in the second game and 0-10 on his Legion Commander in the do-or-die game. T1 was not able to replicate its 2-1 stunner over Neon last Thursday, Feb. 25 which secured them a spot in the Major and forced the best-of-three tiebreaker. Fnatic already bagged the top spot that guarantees a ticket to the Major playoffs after amassing a 6-1 record. Filipino powerhouse TNC Predator (4-3), the last SEA team to win a Major, missed out on the SG tourney but remained in the Upper Division for next season nonetheless.',\n",

       "  'full_article': ' During the PBA bubble, Vic Manuel led Alaska in scoring in the Philippine Cup with almost 16 points per game, alongside six rebounds and nearly three assists. In short, the “Muscle Man” was the main man for the Aces. Now that he is with the Phoenix Super LPG, Manuel said joining a team that is loaded with talent makes the work easier for him and he is willing to accept whatever his role is with the Fuel Masters. “Oo naman. Willing naman ako mag-sacrifice ng role kung yun yung dapat. Saka hindi makaka-bigat sa team,” said Manuel as he guested Saturday on the weekly sports show The Chasedown on One PH over Cignal TV. “Kailangan tulungan ko sila e, yun ang magiging role ko talaga sa Phoenix.” A few days after trading Calvin Abueva to Magnolia Hotshots Pambansang Manok, Phoenix surprised the local basketball scene again when it obtained Manuel from Alaska for Brian Heruela and draft picks. Manuel, who will start practicing with Phoenix on Monday, will join a team the includes Matthew Wright, Jason Perkins, Justin Chua, RJ Jazul and new acquisition Chris Banchero. “Sa Alaska sa akin dumadating ang bola. Dito sa Phoenix madaming pwedeng humawak, madaming puwedeng umiskor anytime. Kung ano lang yung magiging support ko sa kanila, saka kung ano yung makakabuti sa magiging takbo ng Phoenix,” he said. Originally selected No. 9 overall by NorthPort (formerly GlobalPort) during the 2012 PBA Rookie Draft, Phoenix is Manuel’s fifth team after his stints with Meralco, Air21 and Alaska. But unlike from the past when he was dealt from one team to another, Manuel feels his transition would be easy. Not only he is reunited with former Alaska teammates Banchero and Jazul as well as Jake Pscual, Manuel will also have coach Topex Robinson, his former coach in the PBA D-League. “Sa D-League, diyan ako nagsimula sa kanya. Familiar na din ako sa system ni coach Topex. Siguro hindi naman ako mahihirapan i-apply sarili ko dun (with the system),” said Manuel.',\n",

Tiangco reminded his constituents to strictly follow health protocols to avoid the further transmission of the virus. “Bawat isa ay may maitutulong para mapagtagumpayan natin ang laban sa pandemya—manatili sa bahay hanggang maaari, magsuot ng face mask at face shield, dumistansya ng 1-2 metro mula sa iba, at maghugas parati ng mga kamay (Everyone can do something to contain the pandemic. This includes staying at home, wearing face masks and face shields, maintaining a 1-2-meter distance from the others, and washing hands regularly),” he said.

Speaker Allan Lord Velasco and Quezon 4th district Representative Angelina ‘’Helen’’ Tan, earlier lauded the President for signing the measure that would benefit the country’s mostly impoverished 3.5 million coconut farmers. ‘’I am glad that all his concerns and observations when he vetoed the previous coco levy bill versionn were all given due course to reflect the interests of the small coco farmers,’’ Enverga said. ‘’I also commend Speaker Lord Allan Velasco for his determination to push for the enactment of the coco levy law and by guiding us in the committee on agriculture and food in very step of the way providing us significant inputs and direction,’’ he added. He further said: ‘’Senate President (Vicente) ‘Tito’ Sotto (III) and Senator Cynthia Villar, likewise, deserve to be commended as they remained resolute to finally make the bill acceptable to all stakeholders .” Enverga likewise cited all the members of the committee on agriculture and food in Congress “for their untiring efforts and time used just to make the house bill version truly for the benefit of the coco farmers.” ‘’I do expect that the 3.5 million coco farmers will reap the benefits from the funds towards Increased productivity and income for their benefits and for the rehabilitation and modernization of the coconut industry as a whole,’’ he said.',\n",

       "  'full_article': ' Senator Emmanuel “Manny” Pacquiao on Saturday blamed the Philippines’ insurgency problem on the “widespread corruption” that has been denying rural communities of the necessary infrastructure, education and livelihood. In a speech during the 88th Infantry Battalion’s presentation of alleged surrenderees from the New Peoples’ Army (NPA) in Maramag, Bukidnon, Pacquiao said indigenous people (IP) “are easily lured to turn against the government because of the absence of sustainable government support for their communities.” Pacquiao said all “corrupt officials” must be removed from the bureacracy so that rebels would again pledge their allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines. “Hindi nabibigyan ng suporta ang ating mga lumad dahil sa matinding kurapsyon. ‘Yong mga pondo na napupunta dapat sa pagpapatayo ng mga paaralan, paglalagay ng mga kalsada sa kanayunan at pagbibigay ng kabuhayan ay napupunta sa mga kurap at mga ganid na pulitiko (Our lumads are not being given support because of widespread corruption. Funds that should be used for constructing schools, roads and provision of livelihood go to corrupt and greedy politicians),” he said. “Kailangan nating ubusin itong mga kurap upang mas marami pang rebelde ang magbalik-loob sa ating pamahalaan (We should weed out all these corrupt officials so that more rebels will return to the government),” he stressed. Pacquiao also cited the need for “genuine” efforts from the government to help impoverished communities in the country, saying: “Ang laganap na insurgency sa bansa ay bunga ng kapabayaan ng ating pamahalaan (The prevalence of insurgency was a result of our government’s negligence).” He also called for the full implementation of the Republic Act  8371, or the The Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997. He said one pressing problem among lumad communities was the lack of housing despite the law’s provisions that guarantee their right to their ancestral domain. He urged the National Commission of Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) to expedite the issuance of ancestral domain titles for the lumads as a gesture of the government’s commitment to help the IP.',\n",

       "  'full_article': ' When news broke out on the trade that dealt Calvin Abueva to Magnolia Hotshots Pambansang Manok, veteran forward Marc Pingris was one of the team mainstays that reached out and welcomed “The “Beast”. The two, despite their heated clashes in the PBA the past several years, have kept a strong bond following their stint together with Gilas Pilipinas during the 2015 FIBA Asia Championship in China. “Hindi pa kami nagkita pero nag-message kami. Sabi niya ‘brad ayusin mo na diyan’,” said Abueva as he appeared Saturday on the weekly sports show The Chasedown on One PH over Cignal TV. “It’s a big opportunity na andiyan ka (with Magnolia), huwag mo na pakawalan. Ito yung kumpanya na alam mong makaka-ipon ka, maga-grab mo lahat ng opportunity na dadating sayo.” This is the third team for Abueva after stints with Alaska and Phoenix Fuel. While he is considered among the best with his energy and enthusiasm during games, Abueva is also a controversial figure on and off the court. He was suspended for 16 months for unsportsmanlike foul two years ago in former TNT KaTropa import Terrence Jones. He was shipped by Phoenix to Magnolia for Chris Banchero plus draft picks. The arrival of Abueva to the Hotshots gives the team of coach Chito Victolero a solid opportunity to compete for the title, especially in the Philippine Cup, which is tentatively set to start April 9. The 6-foot-3 Abueva joins a frontline of Ian Sangalang, Jackson Corpuz, Rome dela Rosa, Rafi Reavis, while the team’s backcourt rotation remains one of the best in the league with Paul Lee, Mark Barroca, Jio Jalalon and Justin Melton. Also, the possibility of Pingris rejoining Magnolia is something that really excites Abueva. Pingris remains in the injured list as he continues to get in tip-top shape following an injury. “Sana nga magkasama kami dito maski isang season lang bago siya mag-retire. Beterano e, at yung experience niya, yung linaro niya, iba yung experience niya sa experience namin ngayon.”',\n",

The semifinal matches are scheduled on Sunday morning, Feb. 28, with the winners slated to face at 5 p.m. in the finals of the first volleyball and non-professional sports tournament held under a bubble concept amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Two-time runner-up Onic is also eager to break through this season, albeit without its longtime captain-support Johnmar “OhMyV33NUS” Villaluna and carry Danerie James “Wise” Del Rosario, who both moved to Blacklist International. Onic got former Execration core Jaylord “Hate” Gonzales and ex-Blacklist carry Kairi “Kairi” Rayosdelsol as replacements while tapping analyst-caster Caisam “Wolf” Nopueto to help coach Kyle “Ryo” Berceño, a member of the Season 3 titlist ArkAngel. Cignal went through lineup changes as well, replacing Hadess and Vail “tsujin” Alejo with Janus “Janus” Badando and ex-Blacklist standout Arvie “AQUA” Calderon while adding ex-ArkAngel tank Jeff “Kekedot” Mogol as back-up. For its part, the Daniel “Chuuu” Chu-led Work Auster Force made it to Moonton’s professional league after a perfect six-game run in the main qualifiers. But Bren remains as the heavy favorite to hoist the title after keeping its M2 Mobile Legends World Championship winning squad intact. M2 Grand Finals MVP Karl “KarlTzy” Nepomuceno, Angelo “Pheww” Arcangel, CJ “Ribo” Ribo, Allan “Lusty” Castromayor, David “FlapTzy” Canon and sixth man EJ “Ejhay” Sambrano will look to maintain their dominance in the local league. Two-time world champion coach Francis “Duckeyyy” Glindro will be aided by Paulo “Pauloxpert” Munsayac, who was part of Gosu which played in M1. Meanwhile, Season 6 runner-up and M2 participant Omega will take on Execration (Season 6 third place finisher), Blacklist International (5th-6th), Nexplay Solid (7th-8th) and Laus Playbook Esports (qualifier) in Group B. The MPL-PH Season 7’s eight-week group stage will start on March 19, followed by the first playoffs weekend on May 29-30 then the second playoffs weekend which includes the best-of-seven Grand Finals on June 5-6.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Motorist in Valenzuela apprehended, vehicle clamped for pulling over to answer call',\n",
       "  'full_article': ' The Traffic Management Office (TMO) or the “Red Boys” of the Valenzuela City government is facing backlash after apprehending a motorist, clamping his car and leaving him alone on Mindanao Ave. for only pulling over while driving supposedly to answer a call. In a Facebook Live uploaded by Mark Jerald Buenafe on Saturday, an officer was seen clamping the wheel of the car of a male motorist while several other officers blocked him with a tow truck to prevent him from escaping.This came even though the motorist, backed by several witnesses in the area, explained that he just temporarily stopped to answer a call.The motorist also did not even get out of his car and was only there for less than five minutes when he was immediately apprehended, according to Buenafe.“Bigla sya nilapitan at nakorner sya… para kunin ‘yun lisensya nya. Ika nga ng driver ng kotse, ano daw violation nya, tapos my dumating din [na] red boy[s] na dala ‘yung truck [na] pang reker (He was immediately approached by authorities to confiscate his license. The driver even asked what was his violation until the Red Boys eventually arrived with a tow truck),” Buenafe said in a Facebook post uploaded around 10 a.m., which has already garnered 214,000 views as of this writing.Although there was hardly any traffic in the area at that time, the “Red Boys” did not consider the motorist’s explanation. They eventually turned their backs on him and left him alone while his vehicle was clamped.“Anong gagawin nyo dito? May lakad ako, pre. Kung titicketan nyo, ticketan nyo (What would you do to my car? I have errands to do. If you will issue me a citation ticket, just do it),” the apprehended motorist pleaded to the officers.In the video, residents and passersby in the area were heard calling the officers “abusive.” They alleged that the “Red Boys” would even do it to other motorists.“Sobra na kayo (You are being excessive),” several witnesses told the officers, “Kakahinto lang nyan. Abusado kayo eh… Huminto lang, may tumawag eh, alangan naman mag drive (You’re getting abusive. He just stopped because someone called him. He couldn’t continue driving).”This is the second time that the “Red Boys” were criticized on social media.During the early days of the lockdown when mass transportation was suspended, a health worker was issued a citation ticket with P5,000 fine after he was caught backriding with his brother, also a health worker, on a motorcycle while on their way home after duty.The health worker said they even still tried to show their IDs as medical health workers and asked for consideration but to no avail. In a Twitter post on Saturday, Valenzuela City Mayor Rex Gatchalian stressed that “double parking is not allowed anywhere.”“As it is masama na nga ang traffic situation dyan (the traffic situation in the area is already bad), so we are doing everything to make traffic flow freely. Double parking impedes the flow of traffic,” he added.Gatchalian also said that their “people are merely doing their jobs.”The mayor has invited Buenafe to go to his office so they can “have an active discussion on this matter.”',\n",

       "  'full_article': ' Senator Joel Villanueva on Saturday, February 27, expressed his dismay over how law enforcers handled civilians in the recent clash between personnel the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA). In a statement, he said innocent workers and civilians could have been hurt in the alleged “misencounter” between policemen and anti-drug operatives in Quezon City last February 24. “Hindi po natin basta-basta maaaring ipagkibit-balikat ang insidenteng ito dahil tila may naging kapabayaan sa ating mga law enforcement agencies. Karamihan po sa mga naipit sa gitna ng putukan ay mga ordinaryong manggagawa na nagsusumikap sa hirap ng ating buhay ngayong may pandemya (We cannot just ignore this incident because there seems to be negligence on the part of our law enforcement agencies. Most of those caught between the gun fight are ordinary citizens who were just working to alleviate their difficulties during the pandemic),” the chairman of the Senate labor committee said. Villanueva particularly mentioned the viral video clip that showed officers from the PNP’s Special Weapons and Tactics pointing their rifles at civilians in fastfood restaurant as they search for PDEA agents in the group. A pregnant woman was heard crying for calm and a drink of water, saying: “Baka duguin ako, sir (I might bleed, Sir).” While they told the frantic civilians to relax and not to worry, the police officers kept shouting as they told them to put their hand above their head. “Isipin po natin kung isa tayo sa mga nasa silid na iyon. Pumasok ka lang sa trabaho o kaya naman ay pumunta ka lang doon para bumili ng burger para sa anak mo, tapos biglang ganoon ang mangyayari. Kinabukasan, malalaman mo na may nagkalituhan lang pala sa gobyerno (Imagine if we are one of the people in that room. You just went to work or  entered the fastfood to buy some burger for your child, and that’s what happens. And then you would learn on the next day that it was only due to confusion between government forces).” “Ano, sorry na lang po ba ‘yon sa abala? (What, will that just be addressed by a simple ‘sorry for the inconvenience’)?” Villanueva pointed out. “Tinatrabaho po natin dito ang paggawa ng mga batas para protektahan ang ating mga manggagawa, kaya po nakakapanlumo na makakita ng mga crew at sibilyan na tinututukan ng baril at sinisigawan ng mga taong dapat ay kasangga natin sa pagprotekta sa kanila (We worked hard to pass laws protecting our workers, so it’s depressing to see service crew and civilians being intimidated with guns and be shouted at by people who were supposed to protect them),” he lamented. Villanueva said he supports the upcoming inquiry of the Senate Public Order and Dangerous Drugs Committee on the incident, saying it should establish a precise timeline of events to determine where the fault occurred and what measure must be done to prevent another incident. “We have two former PNP chiefs to comb through the details of the law enforcement aspect, and determine what went wrong. Our foremost concern is the welfare of our ordinary kababayans (countryment). Any legitimate law enforcement operations should not place civilians in grave danger,” he said.',\n",

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque confirmed that the Philippines is set to receive 525,600 doses of the British-Swedish vaccines at around 12:50 p.m. on Monday. “We are pleased to inform [you] that the Philippines will receive 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines on Monday, March 1, 2021, around noontime, as part of the first round of allocated doses from the COVAX Facility,” he said. “This forms part of the 44 million doses of COVAX to inoculate 20 percent of our population,” he added. President Duterte’s long-time aide Senator Bong Go confirmed that President Duterte will also be present during the arrival of the AstraZeneca vaccines at the Villamor Airbase. The Philippines is set to receive a total of 5,500,800 to 9,290,400 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines from the COVAX Facility within the first half of the year. It was supposed to take place in the middle of February but got delayed due to the absence of an indemnity agreement. In his statement, Roque thanked Filipinos and foreign partners for believing in the government as the country continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic. “We are grateful to everyone — from our medical frontliners to our fellow Filipinos and foreign partners — who stand by us in this challenging time,” he said. “Together, we will heal and recover as one nation and one people,” he added. In particular, Roque extended the country’s gratitude to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for the vaccines. In a separate video announcement, Roque thanked British Ambassador to the Philippines Daniel Pruce for facilitating the delivery of the AstraZeneca vaccines. “Nagpapasalamat po tayo kay Ambassador Pruce ng Engglatera dahil ang kanyang intercession po ang naging dahilan kung bakit napabilis ang pagdating ng AstraZeneca sa ating bansa (We would like to thank Ambassador Pruce of England because his intercession was the reason for the earlier arrival of the AstraZeneca vaccines in the country),” he said.

       "  'full_article': ' The health crisis brought about by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has forced the countries, including the Philippines, to adapt to new ways of teaching students. Aside from revising its learning standards for students, the Department of Education (DepEd) shifted to alternative learning delivery modalities this school year to ensure that learning will continue even if the students remain at home. Among the the learning delivery options implemented by DepEd include printed modules distributed to students’ homes. This is also supplemented with television and radio-based instruction, online distance learning or blended learning. However, the current learning setup threatens to increase the gap between those who are able to access and continue education and those who could not and could also cause a setback to the development of students’ skill. The current situation can also further impact the children’s ability to learn and express themselves – particularly in English. Even before the crisis, data from the international education company Education First already showed that the ranking of the Philippines in the English Proficiency Index has been declining over the past few years to 27th in 2020 from 13th in 2016. In support of DepEd’s efforts to address the growing threat posed on the public education system by the ongoing pandemic and in view of the significant drop in the country’s global ranking in English proficiency, Globe is helping develop language literacy among children. Under its Global Filipino Teachers (GFT) initiative, Globe – through a partnership with Teach for the Philippines (TFP) – provides essential learning sessions that promote 21st century learning and maximize digital resources among public school teachers and learners amid the COVID-19 crisis. A focus of the GFT learning sessions is Early Language Literacy. During the recent GFT webinars, attendees were taught how to teach pre-reading skills, introduce sound and print, decoding and sight-reading as well as plan a reading program for children under the new normal. Through these webinars, Globe aims to equip educators and parents with the knowledge to conduct an effective reading program to improve learners’ progress as well as guide them on the best offline and online approaches to reading. During the discussions, teachers learned how children can combine strong decoding skills while expanding their sight vocabulary so they can invest more brain energy into comprehending what they are reading. The webinars also tackled the appropriate combination of learning modalities to target different learning goals, ways to monitor learners’ progress, and how to maximize learning by teaching children games and activities that they can engage in repeatedly for independent practice. Teachers were also encouraged to involve students in preparing their own instructional materials out of common household objects and how they can nurture relationships with the children and their families. Globe Chief Sustainability Officer and SVP for Corporate Communications Yoly Crisanto said that the GFT program supports public school teachers with the necessary skills, knowledge, and mindset needed to achieve 21st century learning. “More than ever, these supplementary programs are necessary to promote new skills needed in this new normal,” she added. Meanwhile, TFP’s Marketing and Events Director Angel Ramos noted that teachers and students need all the support that they can get. “With new and innovative techniques in teaching reading to beginning and non-readers, we hope our teachers will be able to help improve our public school students’ learning outcomes even more confidently,” Ramos added.',\n",

       "  'title': 'FIBA OQT good experience as Gilas builds up for 2023 World Cup, says Guiao',\n",
       "  'full_article': ' Former national team coach Yeng Guiao said that young players of Gilas Pilipinas training pool should form the core that will see action in the FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament (OQT) this year in Belgrade, Serbia. Guiao said the experience and wisdom the players would gain in the OQT is irreplaceable as they are being groomed to represent the country when the Philippines co-hosts the 2023 FIBA World Cup. “Ang tingin ko diyan (In my opinion), if we’re going to send a team in the OQT, let’s design it as a preparation also for the FIBA World Cup,” said Guiao when contacted Sunday, Feb. 28, by Manila Bulletin. “The experience is invaluable because they’ll be playing against some of the best teams in the world. It will really help the prospective players, who we feel Gilas can use for the World Cup.” Guiao’s comments came after the Philippines was selected by FIBA for the OQT as a replacement to New Zealand, which opted not to participate in the qualifiers set June 29 to July 4 for the Tokyo Olympics. The country got the spot vacated by the Tall Blacks due to its ranking, the highest among the teams in the Asia-Oceania region. New Zealand skipped the event due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The country, ranked sixth in FIBA’s Asia-Oceania region, is in Group A with host Serbia and the Dominican Republic, while in Group B are Puerto Rico, Senegal and Italy. The top two teams from each group will advance in the crossover semifinal, and winners will play in the one-game final showdown. The champion team gets the Olympic spot. Guiao said that facing Serbia and the Dominican Republic would be tough assignments for the national team. Also, the event is set in late June when the NBA season is over. “That means available na ang mga NBA players by that time (That means NBA players would be available by that time). For example, Serbia, they have four NBA players the last time we played them,” said Guiao, who coached the national team in the 2019 FIBA World Cup in China. “Also, the teams playing in the OQT, they would want to be in the Tokyo Olympics. Gusto din naman natin makarating ang Gilas sa Tokyo Olympics, pero realistically… hindi naman zero, pero mababa (We also want for Gilas Pilipinas to reach the Tokyo Olympics, but realistically… not zero, but the chances are low).” “I’m sure these teams, Serbia, Italy, Dominican Republic, they will put a strong team, pukpok ang mga yan pagdating sa OQT (they will do their best for the upcoming OQT).” added Guiao, the mentor of the NLEX Road Warriors in the PBA. Gilas lost to Serbia 126-67 in that World Cup match up two years ago against a squad made up of Nikola Jokic of the Denver Nuggets, Bogdan Bogdanovic of the Atlanta Hawks, Nemanja Bjelica of the Sacramento Kings, and Boban Marjanovic of the Dallas Mavericks. The four are expected to be called for national team duties, especially when playing in the Tokyo Olympics is up for grabs. Guiao said that if the PBA would be involved in forming the national team for the OQT, the ideal is mixing the pros with the amateur players from the Gilas training pool. The veteran mentor said the likes of June Mar Fajardo of San Miguel Beer and Japeth Aguilar of Barangay Ginebra San Miguel as possible inclusion since both are still good for the 2023 World Cup. “I think it’s best to put together a strong team, malakas pa din dapat ang ipadala kasi ayaw naman natin na mapahiya tayo sa OQT. At least half of the team PBA and half yung mga (young) players na puwedeng makasama sa World Cup,” he said. “Pero kapag ginawa yan na 12 players mga beterano, or PBA players, lalakas nga tayo but I don’t think tatalunin natin yung ibang teams. Long term na din dapat ang view natin. I may be wrong, but akin lang yun (If 12 veteran players or PBA players are, involved, yes we’ll be stronger but I don’t think it’s enough to beat other teams. We have to view it long-term. I may be wrong, but that’s my opinion only).”',\n",

       "  'full_article': ' A true esports professional player that he is, T1’s veteran offlaner Carlo “Kuku” Palad did not take the negative comments about his forgettable performance in the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC)-Southeast Asia Upper Division tiebreaker against Neon Esports too seriously. Kuku finished with a horrendous record of zero kills and 26 deaths in the last two games combined as T1 lost to Neon, 2-1, in the tiebreak for the No. 2 spot that grants a spot in the Singapore Major group stage. His Venomancer went 0-16 in Game 2 while his Legion Commander plunged to 0-10 in Game 3 as the South Korea-based organization settled for No. 3 that gives a seat in the scary wild card phase. As such, viewers on the live stream talked trash on Kuku and even the official casters, in English and in Filipino which seemed to be harsher, had some spicy words to describe his unlikely ugly performance. But the 24-year-old T1 captain was quick to move on and look at the brighter side instead. “Okay lang pasok pa rin kami sa wild card. ‘Yung mga kalaban namin malalakas, okay lang. Practice namin ‘yan. ‘Di naman tayo papadarag eh (We still got into the wild card. Our opponents there will be strong but it’s okay. It will be a good practice for us. But we’re not gonna get stomped),” Kuku said while streaming Dawn of War a few hours after their defeat to Neon on Saturday night, Feb. 27. Kuku and T1 will face TI7 champion Nigma (formerly Team Liquid), possibly two-time TI winner OG and Chinese powerhouse teams Elephant, PSG.LGD or EHOME along with one CIS Squad in the wild card of the first Dota 2 Major tournament of 2021. “‘Kung iisipin mo, sayang talaga kasi one game away kami from qualifying for the group stage. Pero nandyan pa rin naman ‘yung chance so malay niyo baka makatsamba (It was a missed chanced ’cause were one game away from qualifying for the group stage. But still we have a chance in the wild card),” he said. “Kaso napakahirap kasi parang TI na ‘yung wild card eh. Kailangan na lang namin galingan o matuto kami para magamit sa next season. Babawi na lang kami next season (It’s gonna be hard in the wild card because it already looks like TI. We need to do our best or just learn to get back next season).” Kuku also offered no excuses for their loss, admitting that Neon was just the better team that night. “Deserved nila yun. Kami ‘di pa namin deserved ‘yung ganung place, pang-wildcard pa lang kami (They deserved it. We still don’t deserve that place, we’re just right for the wild card now),” said Kuku, who added that he’s taking a rest from playing Dota 2 after the stressful DPC season. Although he took the trash talk in stride, Kuku, still a player that he is, answered back in jest through his live stream caption. “Kuku nyo pagod na, caster nyo panot na.” We’ll just leave it there for you to guess who he was referring to.',\n",

       "  'full_article': ' Roy Cañete and Tani Gomez, veteran members of the Philippine water polo team, are still optimistic about the inclusion of the sport in this year’s Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Vietnam. The two helped the national team to a silver medal finish in the SEA Games two years ago here, but their quest of winning a gold medal in this year’s biennial meet remains a question. Almost eight months after the host country released the sports disciplines for the 2021 meet, the SEA Games organizing committee in Vietnam has yet to act on the appeal of water polo national teams in the region all hoping for the sport to be added. “We’re still waiting. Our hope, our prayer is for water polo to be included,” said Gomez, 39, who has played for the national team since the 2001 Kuala Lumpur SEA Games in Malaysia. “I’m still positive for water polo to be added in the SEA Games. Yes there is an appeal, so for now, as athletes, we just need to keep preparing, keep training,” added the 40-year-old Cañete. The host’s organizing committee has included 40 sports on its initial list of disciplines, and water polo, which has been in the SEA Games since its inclusion in 1965, was left off. Singapore won the gold medal since water polo’s debut in the SEA Games, until Indonesia won the gold medal owing to its win-draw-loss record of 3-1-0 followed by the Philippines (2-2-0) and Singapore (2-1-1). The other nations in the event were Thailand and Malaysia. In the history of the SEA Games, water polo competitions were successfully organized twice despite the non-participation of the host nation – 2009 in Laos and 2013 in Myanmar. “It’s still possible. I think if Vietnam has no team, the five other nations – based on the participation of the last SEA Games – can still hold the event. But it needs to be approved by the organizing committee in Vietnam,” said former national team star and now coach Dale Evangelista.',\n",

However, President Duterte said that for Mayor Carpio, she will become president like him if that was what God really wanted. “Ang sabi niya (She told me): ‘Kung gusto ng Diyos maging presidente rin ako kagaya sa iyo, magiging presidente ako. Hindi kailangan ngayon (If God wants me to become president like you, I will. It doesn’t have to happen now),'” he said. “‘If God does not want me to be president, I will not have that chance no more,'” he recalled his daughter saying. The President added that Carpio was also thinking about the many things she cannot do after her term ends if she ends running in the elections and winning the presidency. “After six years, bata pa siya, anong gawin niya (she’s still young then, what will she do after)?” Duterte said. “As an ex-president, hindi siya makatrabaho, hindi siya maka-appear ng korte. Eh presidente ka na eh (she cannot work, she cannot appear in court because she had already become a president then),” he added. President Duterte has repeatedly said that he does not want Mayor Carpio to run for president because of the disrespect and rude comments she may get if she wins. He also said in a speech in January that the presidency is not a job for a woman.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'The untapped potential of coconut sap vinegar',\n",
       "  'full_article': ' Vinegar is an important part of Philippine cuisine. It is used as both an ingredient and a condiment. In her book “Tikim,” culinary historian Doreen Fernandez writes about the main flavors of Philippine cuisine, which are salty, sweet, bitter, and sour. A Filipino kitchen seems incomplete without a bottle of suka on the shelf. And yet few people stop to think where this pantry essential comes from. Many people buy their vinegar from the grocery store. This may include those that buy repacked vinegar from the sari-sari store since it most probably comes from grocery-bought bottles as well. Most store-bought vinegar is imported. Though there are some local brands, they are dwarfed by their imported counterparts. This is a shame since the Philippines has a rich culture of vinegar making, with many areas known for specializing in a specific type of vinegar. Sukang tuba A popular type of vinegar is sukang tuba, or coconut sap vinegar. “Coco sap vinegar is a naturally fermented coconut sap [that] further undergoes acetification with yeast and bacteria, respectively. It may retain some of the nutrients that are in the coconut sap,” says Ma. Celia M. Raquepo, Division Chief III of the Laboratory Services Division of the Philippine Coconut Authority. “At present, there is no available data as to which specific provinces are known for coco sap vinegar, however, it is common within our country.” Coco sap vinegar is made from the sap of the coconut flower, which is fermented for 8-12 months. “The nutritional benefits of coconut sap vinegar consists of the mineral contents that are retained from coconut sap.  These are phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and significant amounts of micronutrients such as iron, copper, manganese, and zinc,” Raquepo says. Not much data Though it’s popular in many provinces, there’s actually no data on how much the coco sap vinegar industry contributes to the economies of the provinces that produce them because most of its makers have been backyard operations. “There is no available data on this since the coco sap vinegar industry is yet so small…,” Requepo says. “As of now, it is the coconut sap sugar producers that produce and market vinegars in large volumes and those which are assisted by DOST with their acetators (a kind of machine used to ferment vinegar).” That said, locally made coco sap vinegar can go from anywhere between P5 to P85 for 375 milliliters, depending on who produces it and where it is sold. “For the rural areas, the common volume ranges from 375 milliliters – 1 carbouy.  The prices are 375milliters cost PhP 5.00, 750milliters for 10 pesos, 1 carbouy for 100 pesos.  These bears no labels,” Raquepo explains. “The pre-packed and labelled are more expensive and range from 150milliters for P35 and 375milliters for P85.” Why the preference for imported vinegar? Coco sap vinegar is different from the majority of imported vinegars found in grocery stores and supermarkets. “The known imported industrial distilled vinegar comes from corn. Most of our local vinegar is naturally fermented from natural juices,” Raquepo says. Studies have shown, however, that it is very close to apple cider vinegar, which, over decades, has amassed a cult following mostly composed of health buffs. “Investigatory activity as to the comparison of chemical/nutritional composition of coconut sap vinegar with apple cider vinegar shows that coconut sap vinegar is comparable to apple cider vinegar,” Raquepo confirms. There is no official data on why sales for imported commercially distilled vinegar surpasses locally made ones. A few guesses include availability, safety concerns, taste, and marketing. Imported vinegar may be easier to obtain, particularly for urbanites. And because it’s been commercially distilled and packed, it might be deemed “safer” than local vinegars produced on a smaller scale. This does not, however, explain why many people still choose imported vinegar over commercially produced local brands, and is a theory Raquepo disagrees with. “The PCA has not conducted a preference test for this concern,” she says referring to the question of why imported vinegar sales surpass local ones. “However, the issue of being safe is not the real concern but the price (low), until, there was an incident of vinegar adulteration with glacial acetic acid.  There comes the issue of being ‘unsafe’ of the locally made vinegar.” She is referring to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory  released on June 4, 2019 that named five local vinegar brands it found to contain synthetic acetic acid. The report stresses that “the presence of synthetic acetic acid is not a safety issue and does not pose any health risk to consumers as this only means that the vinegar is of substandard quality. The presence of synthetic acetic acid merely represents that the vinegar did not undergo fermentation, either through a slow process, quick process, or submerged culture process which is used for commercial vinegar production.” One surmises that marketing could be a major factor, as many imported brands often have a bigger marketing budget than local ones. In the case of apple cider vinegar, its popularity could stem from its decades-long reputation as a health food. It’s therapeutic claims have been passed along through word of mouth, so it needs little if no advertising. Part of Filipino food culture That said, local vinegars, including sukang tuba, are not without fans. Aside from buyers who live in the same areas as small-scale vinegar makers, there are also a growing number of Filipino food connoisseurs who place a premium on tradition and quality and who are willing to seek out local dishes and ingredients, including different types of local vinegars, whose flavors are vast and varied. All these put together isn’t a significant enough number for the industry to be considered a big one, which is a shame as coco sap vinegar, aside from being a delicious condiment, is also part of the cultural identity of the people who produce and consume it. However, it also means that there is a huge market waiting to be tapped, especially since it’s been discovered that coco sap vinegar has properties similar to that of cult favorite apple cider. “Specifically, coconut farmers are benefitting from coconut sap vinegar making.  This vinegar making is an old tradition in our country and can be done in every backyard of coconut farmers.  Since the coconut sap vinegar was found to be comparable with apple cider vinegar as to its chemical/ nutritional composition, this industry has a potential for more local market and potentially at international market,” Raquepo says. Potential to reach more people When asked how consumers can learn to appreciate local vinegars, which include sukang tuba, Raquepo suggests being an informed buyer: “Consumers can be informed [through] any media platforms like ads (in print or virtual / tv), social [media] and interviews. One best way is through the labels of the products. People/ consumers now are reading the labels of the product and they are more concerned on the health benefits and safety features of the product. Another way is to advertise it where the consumers are, like in supermarkets, wet markets, grocery stores.” It’s the law of supply and demand. If consumers want to see more local vinegars on the shelves, they have to purchase it consistently so that manufacturers, whether small scale or commercial, can make more. Manufacturers can help consumers learn about the product by highlighting its health benefits, such as what happened with coco sugar, where informing the public about its low glycemic index helped it gain the popularity it still enjoys today. The coconut tree is locally referred to as “the tree of life” because every part of it can be used. Coco sap vinegar is but one on a long (and sometimes tasty) list.

       "  'full_article': ' President Duterte said Vice President Leni Robredo should get vaccinated with the CoronaVac first if she was in a hurry, saying he will get vaccinated at the right time after getting the go-signal from his doctor. Duterte made the statement after Robredo said Duterte should be the first person to get vaccinated to ease the public’s concern about the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines. In his speech, President Duterte said Vice President Robredo can go to the front of the line if she was in a hurry. “Siya man ‘yong apurado, siya ang mauna (She’s the one who is in a hurry, she should go first),” he said Sunday evening. Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said last week that 55-year-old Robredo may be qualified to receive the vaccine because of her age if the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19 will allow her. Meanwhile, President Duterte said he was willing to get vaccinated because he is meeting many people but the CoronaVac vaccine was not recommended for those over 59 years old. Duterte will turn 76 on March 28. “I have to defer to my doctor. But I said, on the matter of getting the vaccine, it is my self-preservation [that] will be at issue. Kailangan kong magpabakuna (I have to be vaccinated),” Duterte said. “Ano bang problema nila sa bakuna na talagang magpabakuna man ako (What is their problem about the vaccine when I’m really getting vaccinated)? If I do not want to die and get COVID, I should get one,” he added. Duterte said his doctor was also waiting for another vaccine brand that will be more suitable for him. He, however, refused to specify which vaccine brand they are waiting for. “She thinks that another brand, I will not mention it, iyon na lang ang hinihintay niya (that is what she is waiting for),” he said. “As to what brand, iyan ang problema (that is the problem) because it is left to the sound discretion of my doctor,” he added. President Duterte has agreed to be vaccinated in public but Roque said that the President prefers to receive the vaccine manufactured by Chinese drug maker Sinopharm. The President is set to start its vaccination program on March 1 following the arrival of the donation of the Chinese government of 600,000 CoronaVac shots, the vaccine manufactured by another Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac.',\n",

I have made a declaration that we will adopt an independent foreign policy,” the President said in a media briefing after the turnover of Sinovac to the Philippines. Duterte, however, admitted that he assured China that he will not allow the United States to store nuclear armaments here. “Not because it will antagonize China but because it is in the Philippine Constitution which prohibits the presence of nuclear armaments in the country.” The Philippines plans to renegotiate the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) with the United States a year after the President terminated the accord. The United States maintained its position in ensuring the safety and freedom of navigation in the highly contested waters of the South China Sea even as China becomes increasingly assertive by passing its new Coast Guard law. The law will allow “all necessary means” to stop foreign vessels in places China claims as its own. Duterte, whose stance on China has come under fire numerous times during his term, went on Beijing’s defense once more. “China never asked for anything. China has been giving us everything but never asked anything from us, actually,” he said.',\n",

Duterte made the statement as the country starts the vaccination program against COVID-19 following the arrival of 600,000 doses of CoronaVac shots donated by the Chinese government on Sunday, February 28. In a press conference after the arrival ceremony of the vaccines, President Duterte said that he will remove the restrictions once he sees that the Philippines already has many vaccines available to the people. “Kung makita ko na marami nang vaccine, open ko na lahat, wala na.

Magkaroon lang tayo ng stock ng 2 million, bitawan ko na (Once we have 2 million doses in stock, I ease the restrictions). I will open the economy.

       "  'full_article': ' Despite the start of the country’s vaccination program against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), President Duterte is still against the idea of allowing in-person classes, saying he cannot risk the lives of the youth. Duterte made the statement following the arrival of 600,000 doses of CoronaVac vaccines donated by the Chinese government to the Philippines on Sunday, February 28. In a press conference at the Villamor Airbase in Pasay City, Duterte said it was not yet the time to allow kids back to their classrooms. “Huwag muna ngayon. Not now. It would be — I cannot make that decision. It will place the children in jeopardy,” he said. “I am not ready to lose the lives of our young people, our children. No,” he added. On February 22, presidential spokesman Harry Roque said that Duterte was firm in his decision to not allow the resumption of face-to-face classes, especially for the basic education curriculum. “Nagdesisyon na po ang Presidente: Wala pa rin po tayong face-to-face classes sa bansa (The President has decided: There will still be no face-to-face classes in the Philippines),” he said. “Ayaw po niyang malagay sa panganib o alanganin ang buhay ng ating mga mag-aaral at mga guro habang wala pang nababakunahan sa bansa (He didn’t want to risk the lives of the students and the teachers until no one in the country is vaccinated),” he added. According to Roque, Duterte thought an August pilot of face-to-face classes was more possible after the country has rolled out the vaccination program especially in areas with a low number of COVID-19 cases. “I guess what he is anticipating is that since we will begin vaccination this month, we will be way ahead of our vaccination program in August to give us the confidence to resume at least limited face-to-face education,” he said. President Duterte thumbed down the proposal to have face-to-face classes last year, fearing the spread of COVID-19. Students have been under modular and virtual learning since the start of School Year 2020-2021. Last week, Education Secretary Leonor Briones said that it was the overwhelming sentiment of students to resume the face-to-face classes.',\n",

       "  'full_article': ' President Duterte warned that allowing American bases in the country will put the Philippines in the middle of a war in West Philippine Sea. In a press conference after the turnover of China’s Sinovac vaccine, Duterte said that the “direct consequence” of renewing the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), which he earlier planned to abrogate, is the country will be plunged between two armed forces. “Kung magka-gyera, and it will surely start, maybe the theater of war will be Spratly and China Sea. Katabi lang tayo. Maraming probinsiya ang nandiyan (If there is a war, and it will surely start, maybe the theater of war will be Spratly and China Sea. We are just beside it. Many provinces are there),” Duterte said. If the United States will store armaments in the Philippines, the President said that “we are taking a very big gamble there.” “Kasi kung walang armaments sa Pilipinas, ‘yun lang kailangan natin sa counter-insurgency, okay na (If there are no armaments in the Philippines, only what we need for counter-insurgency, we’re okay). We do not need weapons that can fight other countries because we do not have it– the arms– and we do not want it. Ang unang matamaan, Pilipinas, kasi nandito yung base, eh. Nandito yung mga armas nila. (The Philippines will be the first one to get hit because the base is here). The arms are stored everywhere in the Philippines. Baka hindi ninyo alam. May mga depots all around the Philippines (Maybe you don’t know. There are depots all around the Philippines).” Last year, Duterte terminated the VFA with the United States, but he later on withdrew the process of terminating the agreement. He also seemed to be open to the idea of renegotiating its terms. He earlier said the US should pay the country if it wants to have American bases here. A remark that drew widespread criticism in Congress for what feels like an extortion. “Sinabi ko sa kanila (I told them), I cannot stop you because we are yet to renegotiate the Visiting Forces Agreement. But I am warning you that if I get hold of a hard information that the nuclear armaments are here brought by you, I will immediately ask you to go out and terminate the Visiting Forces Agreement, ora mismo (right away),” Duterte said.

Duterte made the statement as he personally welcomed the Sinovac vaccines donated by the Chinese government to the Philippines at the Villamor Airbase in Pasay City on Sunday, February 28. In his speech during the ceremony, Duterte told Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian that he wants to fly to China just to express his gratitude to President Xi. “Mr. Ambassador, I’d like to just say that towards the — maybe at the end of the year, when everything has settled down — I intend to make a short visit to China to just shake hands with President Xi Jinping and to personally thank him for this donation. Thank you,” he said. In a press conference after the event, the President said he wants to go to Beijing even if it would only be a one-day trip. “If I have to travel to China– even one day– just to tell President Xi Jinping, ‘Thank you, and then I go home,” he said. The President likewise pointed out that China has donated vaccines to many countries but the Philippines was the only country where China made a personal delivery. “China has donated several vaccines to several countries. But it is only the donation made to the Philippines that was carried by a Chinese government plane,” Duterte said. “Iyong iba kinukuha doon sa China.

So I’d like to go to Xiamen before going to Beijing,” he said. President Duterte was supposed to visit the Soledad College of Fujian Normal University in Fuzhou, Fujian Province during his trip to China in August 2019 to inaugurate the building built in honor of his mother.

It said the DSWD Central Office issued the memorandum circular “to provide stiffer policies against erring 4Ps beneficiaries” following reports that some beneficiaries were involved in illegal activities after receiving their emergency cash subsidy under the Social Amelioration Program (SAP). “We would like to imbibe to the 4Ps beneficiaries the sense of responsibility in using the subsidy to augment their needs. We know that the amount is not enough to cover all their needs, but it would be a great help, especially in purchasing their food and other essentials,” DSWD-7 Director Rebecca Geamala said in a statement. She said the in coordination with the local government units (LGUs), the Philippine National Police (PNP), barangay officials, and partner non-government organizations (NGOs), the DSWD consistently guided the beneficiaries and helped them understand that the grants are government funds. “They are always reminded that the cash assistance must be put to good use, and should not be spent outside of its intended purpose, more so, illegal activities,” Geamala said. The DSWD-7 reminded that household cash grants ‘are automatically suspended if a household member is found out to have engaged in prohibited acts’. “The erring member and the rest of the household would undergo case management,” it said. Included in the list of prohibited acts were gambling, use of cash grants for alcoholic beverages, use of any prohibited or illegal drugs, intentional claiming of same grants twice, violation of any existing national and local laws, violation of any rules implemented by the national and local Government to address the contingency, and other vices and prohibited conducts of similar nature. Reinstatement of the household shall be based on the recommendation of the assigned case worker. “The DSWD clarified this measure is not to penalize but to encourage program beneficiaries to be responsible and prudent in spending the grants given to them.” The guidelines are only applicable during the declaration of the state of calamity, national emergency, or other extraordinary condition, the DSWD-7 said.',\n",

       "  'full_article': ' Filipinos who are not in the priority list of the national government will likely receive their coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine shots in the second quarter of 2021. Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., vaccine czar and chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19, said the government will stick to its priority list, which means that medical frontliners will be the first ones to be inoculated with the vaccines in the country. “It [vaccination of healthy population] will probably happen in second quarter. We will prioritize the preservation of our health institutions in the first quarter,” Galvez said after he witnessed the arrival of 600,000 vaccine doses from Sinovac Biotech Ltd. on Sunday, Feb. 28. The Sinovac jabs were donations from the Chinese government. “After that, we will vaccinate [personnel] from government institutions who are providing essential services and other frontline workers including the economic frontliners,” he added. Medical frontliners are on top of the priority list of the national government as to who will be given the COVID-19 vaccines. They are followed by senior citizens, people with comorbidities, and other frontliners such as uniformed personnel. Galvez urged the public to participate in the mass vaccination so the government can achieve herd immunity by inoculating 70 million Filipinos. “The vaccines are our best defense along with the practice of the minimum health standard,” he said. The vaccine czar reiterated that the government cannot afford to be picky on what vaccine brand to give to Filipinos since there is a shortage in supply of COVID-19 vaccines. “I call on the public to get whatever vaccine that we can offer. These vaccines are approved by the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] because they are safe and effective,” he said. “Let us not wait for other vaccines because it will be hard for us. The active cases are rising. Whatever brand we have, let’s take it,” he added.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'FDA clears Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized Johnson & Johnson\\'s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use on Saturday (Feb. 27), making it the third shot cleared for use in the country. \"The authorization of this vaccine expands the availability of vaccines, the best medical prevention method for COVID-19, to help us in the fight against this pandemic, which has claimed over half a million lives in the United States,\" Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock said in a statement. An FDA analysis showed that the single-shot vaccine had a 72% overall efficacy rate in the U.S. and 64% in South Africa, where a highly-transmissible coronavirus variant is causing most new cases, The New York Times reported. The efficacy rate in South Africa is slightly higher than the company had estimated in a recent report, up by seven percentage points. In terms of protecting against severe disease, the vaccine showed 86% efficacy in the U.S. and 82% in South Africa, the Times reported. And the shot was \"100 percent effective in preventing hospitalization and deaths, and that\\'s really what\\'s important,\" Dr. Nancy M. Bennett, a professor of medicine and public health sciences at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, told The Washington Post. \"Those facts are the most important thing to recognize.\" Related: Quick guide: COVID-19 vaccines in use and how they work Johnson & Johnson also monitored for asymptomatic infections by checking for coronavirus antibodies in a small number of volunteers 71 days after they got either the vaccine or a placebo shot. The data shows that the vaccine has 74% efficacy against asymptomatic infections, but \"there is uncertainty about the interpretation of these data,\" given the small number of volunteers assessed, the FDA noted, according to the Times. Despite having a lower overall efficacy rate than the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which are each more than 90% effective, the single-shot vaccine could still make a big difference because it can be stored for months at refrigerator temperatures, rather than requiring deep-freezing, The Washington Post reported. Additionally, the vaccine shows more than 80% efficacy against severe disease and 100% efficacy against hospitalization; this level of protection can prevent trips to the intensive care unit (ICU), thus lessening the burden on health care systems, as well as help vaccinated people avoid the potential long-term impacts of severe COVID-19 infection. —  11 (sometimes) deadly diseases that hopped across species — 14 coronavirus myths busted by science —The 12 deadliest viruses on Earth \"Don\\'t get caught up, necessarily, on the number game, because it\\'s a really good vaccine, and what we need is as many good vaccines as possible,\" Dr. Anthony S. Fauci,the Biden administration\\'s chief medical adviser on COVID-19, told the Times on Saturday (Feb. 27). \"Rather than parsing the difference between 94 and 72, accept the fact that now you have three highly effective vaccines. Period.\" Related: COVID-19 vaccines: What does 95% efficacy actually mean? Similar to the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, the Johnson & Johnson shot contains a weakened version of a common cold virus, known as an adenovirus, Live Science previously reported. Scientists genetically altered the adenovirus, named ad26, so it can no longer infect human cells and then added genes that code for the coronavirus spike protein, a structure that sticks off the pathogen\\'s surface and helps the virus bind to cells. Once inside the body, the vaccine trains the immune system to recognize the spike protein and target the coronavirus for destruction. Janssen Pharmaceuticals, the Johnson & Johnson company that developed the COVID-19 vaccine, used a similar strategy to develop its existing Ebola vaccine. With FDA approval in hand, Johnson & Johnson can now ship about 4 million vaccine doses across the U.S., Dr. Richard Nettles, the vice president of U.S. medical affairs at Janssen Pharmaceuticals, told lawmakers earlier this month, the Times reported. Another 16 million doses should be ready by the end of March and 100 million by the end of June, although the company is currently far behind the number of doses pledged in its federal contract, according to the Times.

       "  'Title': 'Is an electric car better for the planet?',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Which is better for Earth: an electric or gas-powered vehicle? The answer to this question might seem blindingly obvious: Of course electric cars must be better for the environment, because they don’t have exhausts and so don’t emit greenhouse gasses as they drive. However, electric vehicles (EVs) aren\\'t perfect, and they come with their own set of polluting problems. Notably, their batteries contain components, such as lithium, that require a significant amount of energy to source and extract. But battery production is just one part of an electric car\\'s life span. A 2014 study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences looked at the entire life cycle of an EV\\'s emissions, from mining the metals required for the batteries to producing the electricity needed to power them, and then compared this with the average emissions of a gas-powered vehicle. The team found that when electric vehicles are charged with coal-powered electricity, they’re actually worse for the environment than conventional gasoline cars. In much of the world, however, national grids are now clean enough for EVs to beat their gasoline-powered counterparts when it comes to pollution and greenhouse-gas emissions during their lifetimes. \"Only when connected to the dirtiest, coal-heavy electric grids do gasoline internal combustion engines become comparable to EVs on a greenhouse gas basis,\" said Colin Sheppard, a researcher with expertise in energy and transportation systems engineering at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. Related: Who invented the car? There are very few places where electric grids are still supplied entirely or mainly by coal. China is one of them; in 2019 it was estimated that 58% of the country’s power supply came from coal and it’s likely that some parts of China are still entirely supplied by coal. However, China’s grid is improving with more investments in renewables – for example, it has twice the wind energy capacity as the U.S. and it builds more solar panels per year than any other countries, according to Nature magazine. This pattern of improvement — more renewable energies and fewer fossil fuels — is a global one and it helps to boost the environmental credentials of electric vehicles, said Gordon Bauer, an electric vehicle researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation in San Francisco. \"As grids become greener during the lifetime of an electric vehicle, it\\'s only going to get better.\" In a study published this month in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, Sheppard modeled a hypothetical future scenario in which all cars were electric. \"We wanted to understand what the energy, infrastructure and emissions implications might be if all passenger vehicles are electrified,\" Sheppard told Live Science. Bauer also collaborated with Sheppard on the project. Their findings come out strongly in favor of an electric vehicle future. For example, Sheppard calculated that if all privately owned vehicles in the U.S. were electric, it would reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in the country by 46% annually (0.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide) compared with conventionally gas-powered cars. This reduction could be increased even further if those vehicles were subject to so-called \"controlled charging,\" a technique also known as \"smart charging,\" in which vehicles are recharged at strategically chosen times to minimize the financial cost of generating electricity. (For instance, charging at night is often less pricey than during the day; this strategy also favors more efficient energy-producing plants that produce cheaper electricity.) If all privately owned electric cars were charged in such a way, the emissions savings could rise to 49% annually. These estimates are based on what Sheppard admits is an \"ambitious\" imagining of the U.S.\\'s future energy portfolio. This future envisions a country with a lot more renewable energy, but which still hasn\\'t reached the goal of zero carbon, or having a national grid that doesn\\'t contribute to climate change, he said. There is a considerable amount of political will and practical change that needs to happen to make this scenario possible, but it’s still helpful to map out the full theoretical potential electric vehicles under these circumstances. Related: Could we ever pull enough carbon out of the atmosphere to stop climate change? In short, it\\'s far easier to argue in favor of buying an EV than a gas- or diesel-powered vehicle from an environmental perspective. But what about cost? Aren\\'t electric vehicles too expensive for most people to afford? —Does gasoline go bad? —Has the Earth ever been this hot before? —How do we turn oil into plastic? A 2020 report from the consumer rights group, Consumer Reports, suggests this is also changing. The paper estimated that the per-mile repair and maintenance costs over the lifetime of an EV is a little less than half that of traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines. This is largely because electric motors have just one moving part, compared to traditional engines which often have dozens. This means fewer components need to be replaced in an EV, resulting in significant savings albeit not at the point of sale. \"It may sound radical right now, but by the time 2030 rolls around, I think the problem will be about how quickly manufacturers can make them,\" Bauer said. In a recent U.S.-wide analysis carried out by Bauer, he concluded that the high rate of depreciation for new electric vehicles will lead to larger benefits for lower-income households that are more likely to buy used cars. This, along with other factors driving price reductions, such as technological innovations and increased supplier competition, will mean that an EV should cost the same as a conventional gasoline-powered car for almost all income levels by approximately 2029, Bauer found. Furthermore, Bauer calculated that by 2030, low-income households in the U.S. stand to save $1,000 per year from fuel savings if they were to switch to an EV.

       "  'Full Article': 'Oklahomans came face-to-face with popsicle-like alligators — reptiles whose snouts were sticking straight out of the icy water — when the cold snap hit the American South this month. But why were these alligators \"snorkeling\" in such cold weather? Why weren\\'t they sunning on the banks or hiding in their burrows? And who knew Oklahoma even had alligators? The news of the snorkeling alligators sparked a debate on Facebook over whether alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) were a native or introduced species to the state. According to an 1866 description of an alligator written in an Oklahoman man\\'s diary, it appears that they are native, although other alligators have been introduced to wetlands in the state\\'s southeastern corner since then, said Jena Donnell, the Wildlife Diversity Communication Specialist with the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation. As for the alligator\\'s weird snorkeling behavior, it\\'s completely normal, Donnell told Live Science. \"Whenever it ices over, this is a natural response [seen in alligators],\" she said. \"Since the water they were in froze over, they had to create a \\'snorkel,\\' so they tipped their nose out of the water to keep some ice-free water, so they\\'re still able to breathe.\" Related: Alligators vs. crocodiles: Photos reveal who\\'s who Alligators are cold-blooded, or ectothermic creatures, which means their body temperature fluctuates with the ambient temperature. That\\'s why alligators are often found basking in the sun or camping out in burrows with air pockets that they\\'ve dug into the banks of lakes and waterways. When freezing temperatures hit their habitats, gators don\\'t bask on the bank, as cold air can be colder than the water. Instead of hanging out in their burrows, where they might become trapped underwater if the water freezes over, alligators often swim to the surface to go snorkeling, ensuring that they\\'ll have enough oxygen. If the water is cold, but not yet frozen, alligators will often swim to deeper waters, which are warmer than the shallows, Donnell said.  Unfortunately, not all of the alligators survived the cold snap at the Red Slough Wildlife Management Area, a 5,800-acre (2,300 hectares) refuge in southeastern Oklahoma that\\'s managed by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, U.S. Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service.  Donnell didn\\'t immediately know how many alligators had died during the cold snap, but those that did were young. \"Most of the adults were able to survive the cold-weather event,\" she said. \"It\\'s always fascinating how animals will adapt and how they can bring out different survival techniques.\" —Crocs: Ancient predators in a modern world (photos) —Alligator alley: Pictures of monster reptiles —See an alligator devour another alligator in these gruesome photos Freezing temperatures and icy conditions aren\\'t uncommon in southeastern Oklahoma; on average, McCurtain County, where Red Slough is located, has about 60 days a year with temperatures below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius), according to a 2017 study in the journal Herpetological Review.

       "  'Title': 'Why does Christianity have so many denominations?',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Followers of Jesus span the globe. But the global body of more than 2 billion Christians is separated into thousands of denominations. Pentecostal, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Baptist, Apostolic, Methodist — the list goes on. Estimations show there are more than 200 Christian denominations in the U.S. and a staggering 45,000 globally, according to the Center for the Study of Global Christianity. So why does Christianity have so many branches? A cursory look shows that differences in belief, power grabs and corruption all had a part to play. But on some level, differentiation and variety have been markers of Christianity since the very beginning, according to Diarmaid MacCulloch, professor emeritus of church history at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. \"There\\'s never been a united Christianity,\" he told Live Science. Related: Was Jesus a magician? The early church, which spans from the start of Jesus\\' ministry, in A.D. 27, to A.D. 325, was divided primarily based on geography. Worship styles and interpretations of Jesus\\' teachings varied based on regional cultures and customs, according to Bruce Gordon, a professor of ecclesiastical history at Yale Divinity School. But there were also major breaks, or schisms, over Christian theology during this time. One of the most notable early schisms, the Arian controversy in the early fourth century, divided the church on Jesus\\' relationship with God. Arius, a priest from Alexandria, Egypt, claimed that because Jesus was \"begotten,\" or brought about by God, he was a lesser divinity than God. But Athanasius, an Alexandrian theologian, claimed that Jesus was God incarnate. \"This caused major upheaval in the Roman Empire,\" said Christopher West, a doctoral student of ancient Christianity and medieval studies at Yale University. \"It split Christians in the Roman Empire in half.\" The Council of Nicea — a group of theologians and scholars gathered by Emperor Constantine I in A.D. 325 — ultimately sided against Arius. But despite the church\\'s official view, Christians continued to be divided on the subject for more than a century. Then, in 1054, the Eastern Orthodox Christians split from the Western Roman Catholics in what\\'s known as the Great Schism. The two groups disagreed on the taking of the sacraments — religious symbols believed to transmit divine grace to the believer. Furthermore, the Eastern Orthodox Christians disagreed with the Roman beliefs that priests should remain celibate and that the Roman pope had authority over the head of the Eastern church, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. There was even a temporary schism, known as the Western Schism, within the Catholic Church itself in 1378, when two men, and eventually a third, claimed to be the true papal heir. The division lasted almost 40 years, and by the time it was resolved in 1417, the rivaling popes had significantly damaged the reputation of the papal office. Despite this handful of schisms, the Catholic Church successfully suppressed other potential Christian offshoots \"partly by sustained persecution [including] actual military expeditions against some labelled heretics, but then also a new system of enquiries into people\\'s beliefs, called inquisitions. With the backing of secular rulers, heretics might be burned at the stake or forced into denying their beliefs,\" MacCulloch told Live Science via email. Related: What led to the emergence of monotheism? But after the Protestant Reformation in 1517, the number of denominations really began to multiply. The Reformation — instigated by a number of events, most notably Martin Luther\\'s 95 Theses — emphasized a personal faith. This movement was in reaction to the fact that interpretations of the Bible, grace (spontaneously given love and mercy from God), the absolution of sins and entry into heaven were all mediated through priests in Catholicism. Luther and his followers claimed that the Bible, not a church hierarchy, was the ultimate authority over all people, including priests and the pope, and that several ecclesiastical practices, such as granting indulgences (paying the church money to be absolved of sins), were corrupt. Initially, there were just a few major Protestant groups, but ultimately, the Reformation ushered in more Christian offshoots. By the 17th century, the contemporary word \"denomination\" began to be used to describe religious offshoots, Michelle Sanchez, an associate professor of theology at Harvard Divinity School, told Live Science via email. Protestants had used scripture to critique the Roman Catholic Church, claiming that any believer could read scripture and have a personal relationship with God. But then, \"the obvious problem emerged: Whose interpretation of scripture was the right one?\" Sanchez said in an interview. As believers debated the scriptures and sacraments, churches formed and split based on myriad biblical interpretations, ways of worship and organizational structures. From these debates, denominations such as the Presbyterians, Mennonites, Baptists and Quakers, among others, took root. Other Protestant denominations were formed out of a play for power, such as when Henry VIII started the Church of England in 1534. \"He wanted to establish the political autonomy of England, and one way to do that was religious autonomy from Rome,\" West told Live Science. (He also famously wanted a divorce that the church refused to grant.) —Was Jesus a real person? —When was Jesus born? —Where did Satan come from? Although schisms may be seen as divisive or even lead to violent conflicts between rival denominations, these splits do have an upside. \"There\\'s kind of an anti-corruption mechanism in the fragmentation,\" as these splits can offer agency to people in lower social positions, Sanchez said. For instance, after the Reformation challenged papal authority, townspeople could begin to question religious authorities about corrupt or questionable practices. There\\'s likely more denominational splitting and forming to come. On judging the differences between them, MacCulloch offered advice from Jesus himself: \"Ye shall know them by their fruits\" (Matthew 7:16). That is, you can learn about them \"in terms of what they do, their behavior,\" MacCulloch explained. \"That\\'s a pretty good test.\" Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

This dramatic breakup comes after a major crack formed on the shelf in November 2020 and continued to grow until the \\'berg finally broke off Friday morning (Feb. 26). The so-called \"North Rift\" crack is the third major chasm to actively tear across the Brunt Ice Shelf in the last decade, and so scientists with the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) were absolutely expecting the split. \"Our teams at BAS have been prepared for the calving of an iceberg from Brunt Ice Shelf for years,\" Dame Jane Francis, the director of the BAS, said in a statement. \"Over [the] coming weeks or months, the iceberg may move away; or it could run aground and remain close to Brunt Ice Shelf.\" (Icebergs are pieces of ice that have broken off from glaciers or ice shelves and are now floating in open water, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). Related: Photos: diving beneath Antarctica\\'s ross ice shelf The North Rift crack grew toward the northeast at a rate of about 0.6 miles (1 km) per day in January; but on the morning of Feb. 26, the crack widened a couple hundred meters in just hours. This ice split happened due to a natural process, and there\\'s no evidence that climate change played a role, according to the statement. The Brunt Ice Shelf, a 492-foot-thick (150 meters) slab of ice, flows west at 1.2 miles (2 km) per year and routinely calves icebergs. This iceberg, however, happened to be very big, with an estimated size of about 490 square miles (1,270 square km). \"Although the breaking off of large parts of Antarctic ice shelves is an entirely normal part of how they work, large calving events such as the one detected at the Brunt Ice Shelf on Friday remain quite rare and exciting,\" Adrian Luckman, a professor at Swansea University in Wales who was tracking the shelf through satellite images in the last few weeks, told the BBC.  The Brunt Ice Shelf is home to the BAS Halley VI research station, where scientists observe atmospheric and space weather; but the station will likely not be affected by this splitting, according to the statement. Related: Photos: Behind the scenes of an Antarctic research base\\'s relocation In 2016, the BAS relocated the station 20 miles (32 km) inland to avoid the two other major cracks in the ice shelf known as \"Chasm 1\" and the \"Halloween Crack,\" both of which haven\\'t widened any further in the past 18 months, according to the statement. — 50 amazing facts about Antarctica — Life on the edge: photos from drilling the ross Ice Shelf — In photos: Antarctica\\'s larsen C ice shelf through time The research station is now closed for winter, and the 12-person team left Antarctica earlier in February. Because of the unpredictability of iceberg calving, and the difficulty of evacuating during the dark and frigid winters, the research team has been working at the station only during the Antarctic summer over the past four years. More than a dozen GPS monitors measure and relay information about ice deformation of the shelf back to the team in the U.K. every day. The researchers also use satellite images from the European Space Agency, NASA and the German satellite TerraSAR-X to monitor the ice. \"Our job now is to keep a close eye on the situation and assess any potential impact of the present calving on the remaining ice shelf,\" Simon Garrod, the BAS director of operations, said in the statement.

       "  'Title': \"Medium-size dinos are missing from the fossil record. Here's why.\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Medium-size meat-eating dinosaurs are missing from the fossil record, and paleontologists think they\\'ve figured out why. Paleontologists have discovered gargantuan dinosaurs and wee dinosaurs, but a new study finds that there\\'s a conspicuous lack of medium-size carnivorous dinosaur species, especially from the Cretacous period (145.5 million to 65.5 million years ago). Donning their detective hats, the researchers soon found a suspect; megatheropods — the largest of the meat-eating dinosaurs, like Tyrannosaurus rex and Gorgosaurus, which weighed over 2,200 pounds (1,000 kilograms) as adults. It\\'s possible that juvenile megatheropods edged out the middlings, the researchers said. \"Juvenile megatheropods may have outcompeted other medium-sized dinosaurs, resulting in deflated global dinosaur diversity,\" study lead researcher Katlin Schroeder, a doctoral student in the Department of Biology at the University of New Mexico, told Live Science in an email. However, not everyone is convinced that there is a case of missing medium-size dinosaurs; it\\'s possible, for instance, that there are fossils of medium-size beasts that have yet to be found, said Michael D\\'Emic, an associate professor in the Department of Biology at Adelphi University in New York, who wasn\\'t involved in the study. Related: Gory guts: Photos of a T. rex autopsy As egg-laying animals, all dinosaurs started out small, weighing no more than 33 pounds (15 kg) as hatchlings. As dinosaurs grew, some likely occupied different niches and ate different foods than adults of the same species did — for instance, a young T. rex likely couldn\\'t take on a Triceratops, and probably went after smaller prey. To investigate the medium-size mystery, Schroeder and her colleagues logged onto the Paleobiology Database, a nonprofit resource for paleontological data, and they categorized more than 550 dinosaur species as small (22 to 220 pounds, or 10 to 100 kg), medium (220 to 2,200 pounds, or 100 to 1,000 kg) or large (over 2,200 pounds, or 1,000 kg). These dinosaurs lived within 43 communities (groups that lived in the same time and place) across seven continents during the Jurassic period (201 million to 145.5 million years ago) and the Cretaceous period. The researchers found that while communities often had herbivorous dinosaurs in each size category, it was rare to spot a medium-size carnivorous dinosaur in communities with megatheropods. \"It\\'s possible that the \\'gap\\' was being caused by juveniles of those large megatheropods, which may have been eating different things than their parents, and therefore competing with medium-sized carnivores,\" Schroeder said.  The team found the medium-size dinosaur gap was more pronounced in the Cretaceous than in the Jurassic period. During the Cretaceous period, the tyrannosaurs and the abelisaurs were king, and they also looked \"very different as juveniles than they do as adults,\" unlike the megatheropods of the Jurassic, she said. In other words, during the Jurassic period, the megatheropods, such as Allosaurus, didn\\'t change much as they grew, \"and may have actually been sharing food resources, such as giant sauropods [long-neck herbivorous dinosaurs] with their parents,\" Schroeder said. \"This may have allowed more carnivores to coexist in the same communities, resulting in a smaller [medium-size] gap in carnivores.\" But at the end of the Jurassic, a lot of the sauropods went extinct, and so did dinosaurs like Allosaurus. \"They may have been replaced by dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus that used a wider variety of different resources as they grew,\" Schroeder said. Next, Schroeder\\'s team wondered whether the juvenile megatheropods had a bigger effect on the composition of their communities than the adults did. To find out, the researchers calculated how many juveniles and adults each species had in a community. Then, the team figured out the biomass — the number of individuals in a species multiplied by their mass at a certain age. Related: In Photos: Bizarre \\'bat dinosaur\\' discovered in China The researchers found that in some megatheropod species, such as Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, the juveniles represented a larger portion of mass than the adults, likely because it was a dinosaur-eat-dinosaur world back then, and megatheropods didn\\'t always make it to adulthood. This indicates \"that the juveniles had just as much (if not more) effect on their community than the adults did,\" Schroeder said in the email. In fact, there were so many medium-size megatheropod juveniles, they could even be viewed as their own species, in a manner of speaking. \"When we added the juveniles to the communities as their own [species], the gap largely disappeared,\" Schroeder said. —Photos: Thousands of dinosaur tracks along Yukon River —Photos: Dinosaur-era bird sported ribbon-like feathers —Photos: New Triceratops cousin unearthed However, it\\'s possible that something else could explain this medium-size mystery, D\\'Emic said. Twelve out of 43 of the paleo-communities examined in the study don\\'t seem to follow the pattern inferred in the study — that medium-size carnivorous dinosaurs were rare in communities with megatheropods. In these 12 communities, \"they have both large and medium-sized theropods,\" D\\'Emic said. The study explains these exceptions in various ways, but maybe medium-size carnivorous dinosaurs were out there, it\\'s just that paleontologists haven\\'t found their fossils in every community yet, D\\'Emic said. \"Even in relatively well-explored places around the globe, new dinosaur species are discovered each year, so this is not implausible,\" D\\'Emic told Live Science in an email. I\\'s also possible that some dinosaur species in the study were misidentified. Only recently have paleontologists begun to assess bone microstructure, which can reveal a dinosaur\\'s age at death. \"This can show that some small dinosaur individuals belonging to one species were simply juveniles of other species, or conversely, that some small dinosaur individuals thought to be juveniles of one species are instead adults of new dwarf species,\" D\\'Emic said. The study was published online Feb. 25 in the journal Science. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

On Feb. 23, the orbiting ExoMars, a joint mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) and Russia\\'s Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities, captured an image of Mars showing a tiny, pale dot — Perseverance — on the ground far below. Released by the ESA on Feb. 25, the image also shows the rover\\'s jettisoned parachute and backshell, the heat shield and the rocket-powered descent stage, all of which were critical for Perseverance\\'s safe touchdown on Feb. 18. ExoMars also played a part in Perseverance\\'s harrowing landing in Jezero Crater, relaying important data back to Earth that showed the rover\\'s progress, ESA representatives said in a statement. Related: Here\\'s the last thing NASA\\'s Opportunity rover saw before \\'lights out\\' The ESA-Roscosmos orbiter arrived at Mars five years before Perseverance, on Oct. 19, 2016. Its scientific instruments sample and analyze molecules in the Martian atmosphere, so that scientists can better understand how atmospheric gases that appear in very small quantities, such as methane, may signal biological or geological activity on distant planets, according to the ESA. ExoMars also carries cameras, and its Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS) photographed Perseverance from an altitude of approximately 249 miles (400 kilometers). The image is a snapshot of all the stages that took Perseverance through its descent, after the spacecraft shed its cruise stage. The backshell, a small white dot in the far left of the photo, fired small thrusters during the initial descent to keep Perseverance on course, according to NASA. Next to the backshell in the image is another white dot: Perseverance\\'s parachute. It deployed when the rover slowed to less than 1,000 mph (1,600 km/h). Once the parachute opened, the heat shield separated and dropped to the ground; that shield is visible in the photo as a dark speck on the far right. – 5 Mars myths and misconceptions – Voyager to Mars rover: NASA\\'s 10 greatest innovations – Space oddity: 10 bizarre things Earthlings launched into space Perseverance jettisoned the parachute next, firing engines in the descent stage. As soon as the rover touched down, it severed the connecting cables, and the descent stage flew off to land clear of Perseverance. It shows up in the photo as a dark speck about halfway between the rover, and the parachute and backshell. \"The orbiter will continue to provide data-relay support between Earth and Mars for NASA\\'s surface missions,\" the ESA statement said. ExoMars will also play a supporting role when the European Rosalind Franklin rover and the Russian Kazachok surface platform get to Mars in 2023. As Elton John sang in \"Rocketman,\" it\\'s lonely out in space. But on Mars, at least, our robotic ambassadors on the ground and in orbit can keep their \"eyes\" on each other.

       "  'Title': 'Pirate attacks linked to destructive fishing',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Pirates attack more often in waters where illegal and destructive techniques are being used to catch fish, a new study finds. Destructive fishing practices carried out by industrial fleets and illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing can wreck local ecosystems and reduce the catches of small-scale fishers. As a result, fishers may turn to piracy to make money and scare such fleets away from their waters. “The loss of income means that they need to find something else to do,” study first author Raj Desai, a professor of international development at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., told Live Science. Fishers have skills that are very transferable to piracy, such as how to navigate and operate boats, so it’s very simple for them to become pirates, Desai said. And though the piracy is undeniably bad, it may have a benefit for the ecosystem if it winds up deterring illegal and destructive fishing. Related: The most notorious pirates ever Modern pirates attack ships by boarding them with weapons and stealing from the crew and cargo, or by holding them for ransom, Live Science previously reported. These attacks put traders and seafarers at risk and threaten shipping routes, according to the International Chamber of Commerce\\'s International Maritime Bureau, but the specific factors causing maritime piracy are not yet fully understood. To test their hypothesis that fishers may be turning to piracy in response to destructive industrial fleets, the researchers divided up the entire ocean into cells, or spaces, each with an area of about 43 square miles (111 square kilometers). Then, they compared more than 3,200 pirate attacks carried out within each cell between 2005 and 2014 with harmful and illegal fishing practices, accounting for various factors, such as the likelihood of piracy spilling over from one area to another. They described their findings Wednesday (Feb. 24) in the journal PLOS One. The researchers found more attacks in cells where industrial fleets were destroying habitat with methods such as bottom trawling, in which fishers drag a large net along the ocean floor and using chemicals and explosives to kill fish. Such practices produce a very high bycatch — animals with no commercial value that get pulled up alongside the intended catch, Desai said. \"These are very effective methods for collecting a lot of fish but [are] often killing a lot of species that are then discarded, and [that] can have pretty adverse effects on the health and sustainability of the fish stock,\" Desai said. Small-scale fishing economies, mainly serving local consumption, rely on healthy fish stocks and are often in remote areas off the coast of developing countries with few alternative sources of income. Piracy can provide fishers with a higher and stabler income as fish stocks dwindle. That\\'s why it\\'s important to deal with the source of the problem as well as policing the piracy, Desai said. \"The global efforts to fight piracy have focused excessively on interdiction and enforcement efforts and have devoted proportionately less attention to the source of the problem, which is the loss of livelihood and the vulnerability of small-scale fisheries in the developing world,\" Desai said. Other factors are also at play; for example, piracy has happened more frequently in waters off the coasts of unstable countries with fragile governments. — In photos: Pirate ship discovered in the UK — Sunken treasures: The curious science of 7 famous shipwrecks — Images: Pirate tale revealed in Vatican archives \"This is a very interesting study suggesting that destructive and illegal fishing can increase maritime piracy through two mechanisms: one in which those affected by expected earning losses through illegal fishing turn to piracy, [and] a second one anticipating that turning to piracy could help deter such illegal fishing,\" Ursula Daxecker, an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, told Live Science in an email. \"While the study cannot directly test these mechanisms, and presents correlations rather than causal evidence linking IUU fishing and piracy, documenting systematically how different forms of criminality occur in the same places is a valuable contribution,\" Daxecker said.

       "  'Title': 'Hidden scenes in ancient Etruscan paintings revealed',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Scientists using a new technique have uncovered the colorful and once-hidden scenes in paintings of the ancient Etruscans, a group of people who flourished on the Italian peninsula around 2,500 years ago at a time before Rome became powerful. For instance, they found new details in a painting from the \"Tomb of the Monkey\" and scenes of an underworld in another work of art. The Etruscans created detailed paintings, but the passage of time has meant that many of them are now only partly visible and that much of their color has been lost. Related: 7 bizarre ancient cultures that history forgot \"A major issue is the significant loss of information on the polychromy [colors] of the preserved paintings, with special regard to some specific colors owing to their physical chemical composition,\" Gloria Adinolfi, a researcher at Pegaso Srl Archeologia Arte Archeometria (a research institute), said in a presentation given Jan. 8 at the virtual joint annual meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America and the Society for Classical Studies. The fact that some colors survive the passage of time better than others can give a distorted view of what ancient paintings looked like at the time they were painted, Adinolfi said. For example, some shades of green tend not to survive well, whereas red often does, she said. \"Red oaks usually seem to be more resistant so that sometimes reds are dominant and alter the correct perception of the original polychromy of the pictorial decoration,\" Adinolfi said. To reveal the paintings, the scientists used a technique called multi-illumination hyperspectral extraction (MHX), which involves taking dozens of images in the visible, infrared and ultraviolet bands of light and processing them using statistical algorithms developed at the National Research Council of Italy in Pisa, said team member Vincenzo Palleschi, a senior researcher at the research council. The technique can detect Egyptian blue, a color developed in ancient Egypt that \"has a very specific response in a single spectral band,\" Palleschi said. The team also analyzed the residual remains of other remaining colors to help determine what colors were in the painting. By combining the MHX and color analyses, the team revealed vanished scenes from ancient Etruscan paintings. The researchers unveiled several examples during the presentation, including details of paintings depicting the Etruscan underworld showing rocks, trees and water. —Photos: The tomb of an Etruscan prince —The 25 most mysterious archaeological finds on Earth —30 of the world\\'s most valuable treasures that are still missing In the Tomb of the Monkey, so named because a painting in the tomb shows a monkey on a tree, the researchers uncovered details of a painting depicting a person. To the naked eye, the painting looks like a red blur, but after the MHX and color analyses were complete, the painting clearly showed a person carrying an object and details of their hair and face. The tomb was discovered in the 19th century but now, with the new technology, the painting has become much more visible. The team\\'s research is ongoing, and more paintings may be revealed in the future. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Full Article': \"February's full moon, also known as the full Snow Moon, will shine brightly this weekend, and you can catch it if you're in the mood for some early-morning skywatching. The moon will be completely full at exactly 3:17 a.m. EST (2017 GMT) Saturday (Feb. 27). However, the moon will appear full from Thursday night (Feb. 25) until Sunday morning (Feb. 28), so there will be plenty of time to look up and see it, according to NASA. Indigenous groups in the northern and eastern U.S. named February's moon the Snow Moon because of the heavy snowfall that typically occurs during this month, according to the Farmers' Almanac. Moon names such as Snow Moon were applied to the whole lunar month and not just the full moon. Some tribes also referred to February's moon as the Hungry Moon, as the bad weather conditions made hunting for food more difficult than usual, according to the Farmers' Almanac. Related: Top 5 mysteries of the moon A full moon occurs when the moon's orbit brings it 180 degrees away from the sun and the side that is visible to Earth gets a full blast of sunlight, according to Space.com, a sister site of Live Science. Sunlight reflects off the moon's surface, which means a full moon can appear very bright, particularly when it's high in the sky on clear winter nights, according to Space.com. Therefore, it's a good idea to use a moon filter if you want to look comfortably at a full moon through a telescope. This filter will reduce the glare and allow you to see the moon's features — including its impact craters, dead volcanoes and lava flows — in more detail. Determined early-morning sky-gazers will also have the opportunity to identify three planets if they have a clear view of the east-southeast horizon, according to NASA, which gave a summary of celestial events from the perspective of its Washington, D.C., headquarters. —6 wild ways the moon affects animals —Photos: Super Blood Wolf Moon eclipse stuns viewers —Top 10 amazing moon facts Mercury will appear at about 2 degrees above the east-southeast horizon as morning twilight begins at 5:45 a.m. EST (1045 GMT). Saturn will also be visible, though fainter, at about 5 degrees to the right of Mercury and about 4 degrees above the same horizon. Meanwhile, Jupiter will steal the show because it will be brighter than both Mercury and Saturn when it rises to the lower left of Mercury at 5:49 a.m. EST (1049 GMT), 4 minutes after Mercury and Saturn become visible, according to NASA.

       "  'Full Article': \"Near the Markha River in Arctic Siberia, the earth ripples in ways that scientists don't fully understand. Earlier this week, NASA researchers posted a series of satellite images of the peculiar wrinkled landscape to the agency's Earth Observatory website. Taken with the Landsat 8 satellite over several years, the photos show the land on both sides of the Markha River rippling with alternating dark and light stripes. The puzzling effect is visible in all four seasons, but it is most pronounced in winter, when white snow makes the contrasting pattern even more stark. Why is this particular section of Siberia so stripy? Scientists aren't totally sure, and several experts offered NASA conflicting explanations. Related: Earth's 8 biggest mysteries One possible explanation is written in the icy ground. This region of the Central Siberian Plateau spends about 90% of the year covered in permafrost, according to NASA, though it occasionally thaws for brief intervals. Patches of land that continuously freeze, thaw and freeze again have been known to take on strange circular or stripy designs called patterned ground, scientists reported in a study published in January 2003 in the journal Science. The effect occurs when soils and stones naturally sort themselves during the freeze-thaw cycle.  However, other examples of patterned ground — such as the stone circles of Svalbard, Norway — tend to be much smaller in scale than the stripes seen in Siberia. Another possible explanation is erosion. Thomas Crafford, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, told NASA that the stripes resemble a pattern in sedimentary rocks known as layer cake geology. These patterns occur when snowmelt or rain trickles downhill, chipping and flushing pieces of sedimentary rock into piles. The process can reveal slabs of sediment that look like slices of a layer cake, Crafford said, with the darker stripes representing steeper areas and the lighter stripes signifying flatter areas. The 11 biggest volcanic eruptions in history\\nThe world's weirdest geological formations\\n7 ways Earth changes in the blink of an eye In accordance with the image above, this sort of sedimentary layering would stand out more in winter, when white snow rests on the flatter areas, making them appear even lighter. The pattern fades as it approaches the river, where sediment gathers into more uniform piles along the banks after millions of years of erosion, Crafford added. This explanation seems to fit well, according to NASA. But until the region can be studied up close, it'll remain another one of those quintessentially Siberian curiosities.

       "  'Full Article': 'Months of social distancing to slow the spread of COVID-19 have kept many people from getting regular haircuts. But even the most overgrown stay-at-home hair can\\'t compare with the plight of a merino sheep in Australia wearing a whopping 78 lbs. (35 kilograms) of overgrown, matted fleece. Domesticated sheep usually undergo annual shearings to keep their coats in check. However, this particular ram, nicknamed Baarack, was roaming wild in a state forest in Victoria, Australia. He hadn\\'t been shorn in years, and his fleece had grown into a dense, gargantuan mass by the time he was captured and brought to Edgar\\'s Mission Farm Sanctuary for rescued farm animals in Lancefield, Victoria, a representative of the nonprofit told Live Science in an email. There, Baarack was finally shorn of his heavy, woolly burden, which weighed about as much as a 10-year-old child. Under the pounds of matted wool — stained with dirt, studded with twigs and crawling with insects — \"was not Australia\\'s answer to the yeti, but a sheep,\" Edgar\\'s Mission wrote on Facebook on Feb. 10. Related: The 12 weirdest animal discoveries At one point in the past, Baarack had an owner, as he had been castrated and mulesed — a practice that removes skin from around a sheep\\'s tail, creating smooth scar tissue that deters blowflies, according to Australia\\'s Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). His ears also showed signs of tagging, though the tags were long gone, possibly torn out by the weight of his overgrown coat, according to Edgar\\'s Mission. Photos of Baarack before his haircut show the sheep\\'s muzzle poking out of an enormous and very crusty wool cocoon. When the sheep was standing, only his hooves and a small section of his lower legs were visible; when he lay down, his legs disappeared entirely. The load of wool around his head was so heavy that it partly hid his face, and the fleece\\'s weight pulled on his lower eyelids, exposing his eyes to grit and dust. He had a painful ulcer in one eye from a stuck grass seed, according to the mission representative.  Evidence from mitochondrial DNA — which comes from a separate genome inside mitochondria, or energy-making cells — in wild and modern sheep indicates that domesticated sheep are descended from the mouflon (Ovis orientalis), and their domestication began around 11,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, researchers reported in 2018 in the Eurasian Journal of Applied Biotechnology. Over thousands of years, sheep were selectively bred to produce wool for human use, and domesticated sheep no longer shed their coats seasonally, as their wild relatives do. – Photos: The power and beauty of North America\\'s bighorn sheep – Gallery of wonders: The weirdest world records – 8 mammals that have been cloned since Dolly the sheep Left unshorn, their woolly coats continue to grow. Overgrown coats create health hazards for the sheep, making them prone to injury and infections, and hampering the animals\\' ability to regulate their body temperature, according to North Dakota State University. In 2015, an overgrown merino sheep named Chris (also in Australia) set a record for having the most wool removed in one shearing, shedding more than 90 lbs. (41 kg) of matted fleece, Live Science previously reported. RSPCA staff rescued Chris from the wild; they estimated that Chris hadn\\'t been shorn in at least five years.  The amount of wool removed from Baarack would be enough to knit about 61 sweaters or 490 pairs of men\\'s socks, The Guardian reported on Feb. 24. Now that the beleaguered Baarack doesn\\'t have to peer through a curtain of matted, crusty fleece, his future definitely looks a lot brighter.

       "  'Full Article': 'A new coronavirus variant with concerning mutations is on the rise in New York City, according to news reports. This latest coronavirus variant, dubbed B.1.526, first emerged in New York in November 2020, and it now accounts for about 25% of coronavirus genomes that were sequenced from New York in February and posted to a global database called GISAID, according to The New York Times. Researchers at the California Institute of Technology identified B.1.526 after looking through that database for mutations in the virus\\'s spike protein, or the structure that allows the virus to bind to and enter human cells. The researchers have posted their findings, which have yet to be peer-reviewed, to the preprint database bioRxiv. Two \"branches\" or versions of the B.1.526 lineage exist, both with worrisome mutations. One branch has a mutation called E484K, which has also been seen in other coronavirus variants, including those identified in South Africa and Brazil. This mutation may reduce the ability of certain antibodies to neutralize, or inactivate, the virus, and may help the coronavirus partially evade COVID-19 vaccines, Live Science previously reported. The other branch has a mutation called S477N, which may help the virus bind more tightly to cells, the Times reported.

They found that the percentage of patients infected with the version of B.1.526 with the E484K mutation had increased quite rapidly in recent weeks, and it now infects 12% of their patients. \"We find the rate of detection of this new variant is going up over the past few weeks. A concern is that it might be beginning to overtake other strains, just like the U.K. and South African variants\" did in those countries, Dr. David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at Columbia University who led the Colubmia study, told CNN. However, Ho added that more research is needed to determine if B.1.526 is winning out over other variants. \"Given the involvement of E484K or S477N [mutations], combined with the fact that the New York region has a lot of standing immunity [to earlier coronavirus strains] from the spring wave, this is definitely one to watch,\" Kristian Andersen, a virologist at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, told the Times.

The car-sized Perseverance captured a gorgeous 360-degree panorama of its surroundings on the floor of Jezero Crater, which harbored a lake and a river delta billions of years ago. The photo, which NASA released today (Feb. 24), is composed of 142 individual images taken by Perseverance\\'s Mastcam-Z camera system on Saturday (Feb. 21), three days after the rover touched down. Related: Where to find the Perseverance rover\\'s latest Mars photos\\nLive updates: NASA\\'s Perseverance Mars rover mission Mission team members had already stitched together a Jezero panorama using images taken on Friday (Feb. 20) by Perseverance\\'s navigation cameras. But the high-definition Mastcam-Z has sharper eyes, so the newly unveiled photo is more striking and detailed. Jezero\\'s distant rim is visible in the new photo, as is a cliff face that\\'s a remnant of the ancient delta, NASA officials said.

As its name suggests, Mastcam-Z sits on Perseverance\\'s headlike mast. The system consists of two zoomable cameras that can resolve features as small as 0.1 to 0.2 inches (3 to 5 millimeters) across close to the rover and 6.5 to 10 feet across (2 to 3 meters) in the distance, NASA officials said. Mastcam-Z is similar to the Mastcam system on Perserverance\\'s predecessor, the Curiosity rover, which touched down inside Mars\\' Gale Crater in August 2012 and is still going strong.

       "  'Full Article': 'COVID-19 has caused millions of more illnesses than its predecessor, SARS, even though both diseases are caused by similar coronaviruses. Now, a new study suggests one reason why SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is much more transmissible than SARS-CoV-1, which causes SARS. The study researchers focused on the spike protein, the structure that allows coronaviruses to bind to and enter human cells. Before either of the coronaviruses binds, it shifts its spike protein from an \"inactive\" to an \"active\" state. Molecular simulations of these two coronaviruses suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can more easily stay in the active state and keep this position; while SARS-CoV-1 quickly alternates between the two states, which gives it less time to bind to cells. \"We discovered in these simulations that SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 have completely different ways of changing their shape, and on different time scales,\" study senior author Mahmoud Moradi, an assistant professor of physical chemistry and biochemistry at University of Arkansas, said in a statement. \"SARS-CoV-1 moves faster, it activates and deactivates, which doesn\\'t give it as much time to stick to the human cell because it\\'s not as stable. SARS-CoV-2, on the other hand, is stable and ready to attack,\" said Moradi, who will present the findings, which are not yet peer-reviewed, on Thursday (Feb. 25) at the 65th Annual Meeting of the Biophysical Society, which is being held virtually this week. Related: 20 of the worst epidemics and pandemics in history  In the year since SARS-CoV-2 emerged, it has infected more than 112 million people worldwide and is still spreading. In contrast, SARS caused a little more than 8,000 illnesses during an outbreak in 2003, but it was contained before spreading further, with the last cases reported in 2004, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While many studies have focused on the binding of the spike protein to human cells, relatively few have looked at the spike protein\\'s transition between the active and inactive states. —The sneaky way the coronavirus mutates to escape the immune system —14 coronavirus myths busted by science —11 (sometimes) deadly diseases that hopped across species Based on the new study results, \"we hypothesize that the greater propensity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to remain in the active conformation contributes to the higher transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV-1,\" the researchers wrote in their paper, which has been posted to the preprint database bioRxiv. The findings also suggest that a region at the tip of the spike protein, known as the N-terminal domain (NTD), helps stabilize the spike protein. The N-terminal domain hasn\\'t received much attention from researchers because it doesn\\'t directly bind to human cells. But the NTD appears to be involved in the spike protein\\'s transition from the inactive to active state, and so mutations in the region could affect transmissibility, the researchers said. The results may also have implications for future therapeutics for COVID-19. \"We could design therapeutics that alter the dynamics [of the spike protein] and make the inactive state more stable, thereby promoting the deactivation of SARS-CoV-2. That is a strategy that hasn\\'t yet been adopted,\" Moradi said in the statement. Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Full Article': 'For knife-toothed kukri snakes, the tastiest parts of a frog are its organs, preferably sliced out of the body cavity and eaten while the frog is still alive. After observing this grisly habit for the first time in Thailand, scientists have spotted two more kukri snake species that feast on the organs of living frogs and toads. The new (and gory) observations suggested that this behavior is more widespread in this snake group than expected. Two snakes also eventually swallowed their prey whole, raising new questions about why they would extract the living animals\\' organs first. The scientists documented a Taiwanese kukri snake (Oligodon formosanus) and an ocellated kukri snake (Oligodon ocellatus) pursuing amphibian organ meals, tearing open frogs\\' and toads\\' abdomens and burying their heads inside, according to the studies. O. formosanus would even perform \"death rolls\" while clutching its prey, perhaps to shake the organs loose. As the snakes swallowed the organs one by one, the amphibians were still alive. Sometimes, the process would take hours, the researchers reported. Related: Beastly feasts: Amazing photos of animals and their prey There are 83 species of kukri snakes in the Oligodon genus in Asia. The snakes typically measure no more than 3 feet (100 centimeters) long, and the group\\'s name comes from the kukri, a curved machete from Nepal, as its shape is reminiscent of the snakes\\' large, highly modified rear teeth. Kukri snakes use these teeth for slicing into eggs, but they can also be formidable slashing weapons (as some very unfortunate frogs have discovered). In one study, published Feb. 15 in the journal Herpetozoa, scientists described three snake attacks on rotund banded bullfrogs (Kaloula pulchra), which are so round that they are also known as bubble frogs or chubby frogs. They have brown backs with lighter stripes down their sides and cream-colored stomachs, and they measure up to 3 inches (8 cm) long, according to Thai National Parks. Two of the attacks were by Taiwanese kukri snakes, and took place in Hong Kong in October 2020. One snake, filmed on Oct. 2 in a residential neighborhood garden, emerged from a hole in the ground to bite a passing bubble frog, slicing open the frog and stuffing its head inside. Snake and frog tussled for about 40 minutes; the snake performed about 15 body rotations, or \"death rolls,\" during the battle, according to the study. \"We believe that the purpose of these death rolls was to tear out organs to be subsequently swallowed,\" Henrik Bringsøe, lead author of both studies and an amateur herpetologist and naturalist, said in a statement.  A second Taiwanese kukri snake was discovered on Oct. 8 in an urban park while \"energetically\" dining on a frog\\'s organs that were \"exposed and visible,\" the study authors wrote. The third attack on a bubble frog was by a small-banded kukri snake — the species that was first documented exhibiting this behavior — on Sept. 15, at a factory site outside a small village in northeastern Thailand. During the struggle, the snake performed 11 death rolls, its teeth buried firmly in the frog\\'s belly. \"The snake’s efforts resulted in its teeth penetrating the abdomen to such an extent that blood and possibly some organ tissue appeared,\" the scientists reported. \"Eventually, the frog was swallowed whole while still alive.\" Another study, published on the same day in Herpetozoa, presented an observation of an ocellated kukri snake feasting on an Asian common toad (Duttaphrynus melanostictus) inside a lodge in a national park in southern Vietnam. These toads are stout, thick-skinned and variably colored, and they measure about 3 inches (8.5 cm) long, according to Animal Diversity Web, a biodiversity database maintained by the University of Michigan\\'s Museum of Zoology. Observers recorded this attack on May 31, 2020. The toad was already dead at the time, \"and the snake was moving its head and neck side to side as if trying to work its way inside,\" the study authors wrote. Minutes later, the snake gulped down the toad whole.  – Exquisite corpses: Biologists share #BestCarcass photos – Top 10 deadliest animals (photos) – Photos: A Bronze Age burial with headless toads In the 2020 study about small-banded kukri snakes eviscerating Asian common toads, the scientists hypothesized that the snakes selectively ate the organs to avoid the toads\\' deadly toxins. However, the ocellated kukri snake swallowed the toad after its organ appetizer, hinting that the snakes might have some natural resistance to the toads\\' poison. Chubby frogs also have a built-in deterrent that may encourage predators to go straight for their organs. While the frogs aren\\'t toxic, they defensively secrete a sticky mucous that has an unpleasant taste, according to the University of California, Berkeley\\'s AmphibiaWeb. \"We hope that future observations may uncover additional aspects of the fascinating feeding habits of kukri snakes — though we may indeed call them gruesome!\" Bringsøe said in the statement.

       "  'Title': '1st time-lapse of rare moonflower blooming is stunning',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'A rare Amazonian cactus that blooms only once a year for just 12 hours has successfully flowered in the U.K. for the first time, capturing the attention of hundreds of thousands of people around the world who watched the event online. The moonflower (Selenicereus wittii) is a rather unusual cactus with a flattened stem that spirals around other trees like ribbons. It grows deep inside a single patch of rainforest in Brazil and flowers for a single night every year, so only a handful of people have witnessed the blooming process in the wild. On Feb. 20, a moonflower at Cambridge University Botanic Garden (CUBG) bloomed and the entire process was captured on film for the first time. More than 400,000 people watched the livestream on the CUBG website and YouTube channel, according to the BBC. \"It\\'s been absolutely overwhelming for us,\" Alex Summers, the CUBG greenhouse supervisor in charge of the moonflower, told Live Science. \"Growing plants doesn\\'t normally get this amount of attention and coverage.\" Related: Naughty by nature: The most disgusting and deadly flowers The blooming provided scientists with a rare opportunity to attempt to pollinate it, which could potentially allow them to grow more of these beautiful and bizarre cacti in the future. The moonflower has been in the CUBG collection since 2015 and has wrapped itself around a water chestnut tree (Eleocharis dulcis) in the tropical greenhouse. Unfortunately, the greenhouse has been closed for renovations during the COVID-19 pandemic, so the staff decided to set up a livestream and share the flowering cactus online. \"In the case of this species, we are probably the only people to have captured time-lapse footage of it blooming,\" Summers said. The livestream started on Feb. 9 after a growth spurt of the plant\\'s flowering shoot, which reached 7.9 inches (20 centimeters) in length. CUBG scientists believed it would start blooming then, but it actually ended up growing to 11 inches (28 cm) long.  Eventually, 11 days later, the sepals — the protective petal-like structures surrounding the flower bud — began to part, indicating it was almost ready to bloom. The blooming process began at 3 p.m. local time on Feb. 20, which was unexpected since the moonflower normally only blooms at night. Lighting for the livestream may have thrown the plant off its natural rhythm, the botanical scientists said. \"We used supplementary lighting for the webcam, and we think that probably had an effect on the plant\\'s circadian rhythm,\" said Summers. A circadian rhythm is an organism\\'s biological clock and is normally governed by natural light cycles. The flower hit full bloom at 5 p.m. local time, when it reached a maximum diameter of 5.9 inches (15 cm). But by 3 a.m. on Feb. 21, the flower had already closed up. \"It\\'s been amazing because we never expected for it to get the sort of attention it has got,\" said Summers. \"People really stuck with it and it allowed us to talk to them about the plant and things related to it, like the importance of biodiversity.\" In the wild, the moonflowers must be pollinated by one of two species of hawkmoth (Cocytius cruentus and Amphimoena walkeri), which are the only insects with proboscises (tongues) capable of reaching the nectar at the base of the moonflower\\'s long shoot, according to CUBG. Because the moonflower blooms for such a short time, it must attract these hawkmoths as soon as possible. To do this, the flower gives off a strong scent, similar to honeysuckle or gardenia, which entices the moths. However, because of the flower\\'s brief appearance that smell quickly turns sour.  \"The smell quickly changes from something very pleasant to something quite foul.\" said Summers. \"As the chemicals behind the scent break down, they turn into chemicals that are less pleasant smelling.\" By the time the flower closed, Summers described the smell as \"similar to a public urinal.\" Hawkmoths pick up the moonflower\\'s pollen while feeding on the nectar and transfer it to the stigma on another moonflower, which allows the fertilized moonflower to create seeds that can be dispersed and grow into new plants.  However, as there were no hawkmoths or other moonflowers for natural pollination to happen at the botanical garden, the researchers used a paintbrush to take the pollen produced by the flower and transfer it to the stigma on the same flower. This is known as self-pollination and can happen naturally, but it is not an ideal way for a plant to reproduce. — 7 plants you can eat if you\\'re stranded in the wild — Plant photos: Amazing botanical shots by Karl Blossfeldt — 9 myths about seasonal allergies \"They\\'re exactly the same as all organisms, they want to mix their genes with different individuals of their species and not themselves,\" said Summers. Therefore, plants often have counter-measures in place to stop self-pollination. Summers doesn\\'t know if that will be the case with this moonflower. \"We hope that the pollen will be able to pollinate it,\" said Summers. \"But we don\\'t hold out much hope that it will be successful.\" Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Greek ship carrying parts of the Parthenon is giving up more secrets',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'The latest expedition by divers to the wreck of the Mentor, which sank just off the island of Kythera (also spelled Kithira and Kythira) in 1802, has recovered several pieces of the ship\\'s rigging, coins, the leather sole of a shoe, a metal buckle, a token for playing cards, two chess pieces, fragments of cooking utensils and other seemingly mundane objects. When it sank, the ship was carrying marble sculptures chipped from the badly damaged Parthenon in Athens — later known as the \"Elgin Marbles or Parthenon Marbles. These spectacular sculptures — which depict Greek gods, heroes and animals — are now on display at the British Museum in London. Related: 20 of the most mysterious shipwrecks ever But the small objects recovered from the wreck reveal intriguing aspects of the lives of the people onboard the ship when it sank, said marine archaeologist Dimitris Kourkoumelis, of the Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities, a department of the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sports. \"The target is to understand how people were living and how was life onboard, not only for the passengers but also for the crew,\" Kourkoumelis told Live Science. \"We\\'ve found gold coins from Utrecht in Holland, as well as from Spain, and also coins from the Ottoman Empire — so it was really a cosmopolitan group [of people] on the Mentor.\"     The Mentor was an American-built brig that belonged to the British diplomat Thomas Bruce, a Scottish nobleman titled the seventh Earl of Elgin. Elgin, as he was known, used the ship to carry antiquities to England that he\\'d collected while stationed in Constantinople as Britain\\'s ambassador to the Ottoman Empire.Although the ship made it to Kythera, where its passengers and crew scrambled onto the rocks, the Mentor soon sank beneath about 65 feet (20 meters) of seawater. Elgin\\'s secretary, William Hamilton, then spent almost two years on Kythera, overseeing the salvage of the sculptures by sponge divers, who were paid to recover them from the wreck without any diving equipment. Related: 30 of the world\\'s most valuable treasures that are still missing The sculptures were then shipped to England, and Elgin sold them to the British Museum in 1816. Elgin claimed he\\'d paid for the sculptures and that he\\'d obtained a decree from the ruling Ottoman government to take them. But no evidence of the decree has ever been found, according to the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, a nongovernmental organization. When Greece recovered its independence from the Ottomans in 1832, it began a series of projects to retrieve looted art, and the Elgin Marbles were at the top of the list. Since then, every successive Greek government has demanded that the sculptures be returned. So far, however, the British Museum has refused, although it has offered to loan them out temporarily.       Kourkoumelis has led diving expeditions to the wreck of the Mentor every summer since 2009, after the Greek government enacted legislation to protect the shipwreck and formally ordered state archaeologists to excavate it. According to Kourkoumelis, the construction of the Mentor is very different from that of similar ships built in the Mediterranean. \"The American ships were built to travel in the open ocean, and so they were much stronger — it\\'s very interesting to work on a ship like that,\" he said. The wooden vessel is now rotting away after more than 200 years under the waves, and only a few more years of excavations will be possible, he said. No more items from Elgin\\'s collection have ever been found, but the wreck has yielded numerous small objects over the years, including gold jewelry, ancient coins and Greek pottery that probably came from the private collections of some of the passengers onboard when it sank, he said. —The 25 most mysterious archaeological finds on Earth —7 bizarre ancient cultures that history forgot —Mayday! 17 mysterious shipwrecks you can see on Google Earth The most recent finds last year included two wooden chess pieces — another six pieces from the same set were found in previous years — and a metal token or coin that was probably used in a card game. Archaeologists plan to scientifically examine all of the items, many of which will be displayed at the Acropolis Museum in Athens, Kourkoumelis said. The museum already displays about half of the Parthenon sculptures that remain, and it has space reserved for the Elgin Marbles if they are ever returned to Greece. \"We are excavating the ship that is associated with one of the most painful episodes of the recent history of Greece,\" Kourkoumelis said. \"I think it is very important to show that we are not only asking for things, but we are working for the protection of everything that is involved.\" Originally published on Live Science.',\n",

       "  'Title': 'Ghost particle travels 750 million light-years, ends up buried under the Antarctic ice',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'For the first time ever, scientists have received mysteriously delayed signals from two supermassive black holes that snacked on stars in their vicinity. In the first case, a black hole weighing as much as 30 million suns located in a galaxy approximately 750 million light-years away gobbled up a star that passed too close to its edge. Light from the event was spotted in April 2019, but six months later a telescope in Antarctica captured an extremely high-energy and ghostly particle — a neutrino — that was apparently burped out during the feast. A second incident involved a supermassive black hole with around 1 million times the sun\\'s mass in a galaxy about 700 million light-years away. Observatories spied it lunching on a star in August 2015 and then going quiet before a sudden burst of radio waves emerged in February 2016 and then again, almost four years later, in July 2019. Related: 10 huge black hole findings from 2020 Both occurrences involve what\\'s known as a tidal disruption event (TDE), where a supermassive black hole shreds a star to pieces using its colossal gravitational pull — essentially an extreme version of how the moon\\'s gravitational pull raises tides on the Earth. Such cosmic events are still not well understood and these two new findings should greatly help astronomers unlock their inner workings. \"Every time we detect a new TDE, there can always be something exciting and unexpected associated with it,\" Jane Dai, who studies high-energy astrophysics at the University of Hong Kong, told Live Science. \"So there is a lot of new physics that can be done,\" added Dai, who was not involved in either finding. Researchers classify tidal disruption events as \"transient\" phenomena, since they typically flare over the course of a few days and then dim again. What exactly is creating the light in such cases is still not entirely clear, Assaf Horesh, an astronomer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel and co-author on two papers about the new events, told Live Science. As the supermassive black hole tears apart its stellar meal, the star becomes \"spaghettified\" into a long thin stream. This torrent of material wraps around the black hole and is thought to produce a jet of energy as it circles like water going down a drain, though other models predict that some of the former star might explode outward and interact with surrounding gas and dust, generating the flare, Horesh said.  Given the extreme environment surrounding the black hole, particles can become greatly accelerated in processes akin to atom smashers like the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. Neutrinos are tiny specks roughly 500,000 times lighter than an electron and, being neutral (having no charge), don\\'t interact with much as they fly through the cosmos. This allowed a single neutrino to travel outward from the first TDE and head toward Earth, eventually appearing in a square-kilometer-size instrument known as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory buried in the Antarctic ice. Researchers labeled the detection IC191001A and calculated that it had nearly 1 quadrillion electronvolts of energy, making it among the most powerful neutrinos IceCube has ever seen, according to one of the new papers, which was published Feb. 22 in the journal Nature Astronomy. While physicists have predicted that neutrinos are produced in tidal disruption events, astronomers have never tied a neutrino back to a particular TDE, making this a spectacular first. As to why it arrived six months after the event itself, \"I have no clue,\" said Horesh. — 12 strangest objects in the universe — 18 biggest unsolved mysteries in physics — 12 biggest objects in the universe A similar mystery surrounds the second study he led, also in Nature Astronomy . In that case, optical light — the kind our eyes see — was seen to flare from a snacking black hole and then fade away, as per usual for these phenomena. Horesh and his co-authors decided to conduct follow-up studies using the Karl Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) telescope in New Mexico, which detects radio waves. They saw nothing coming from the black hole for months and then, suddenly, six months after the initial event, a bright radio flare. Even stranger, VLA data collected almost four years later showed another curious burst of radio energy. \"Someone can make up a story for why we saw something six months later,\" Horesh said. \"There is nothing to explain why it should flare up, decay and then flare up again. It\\'s really interesting.\" He points to the need for new models that can explain these delayed signals. His team speculates that part of the jet of energy is coming out at an odd angle, producing a flaring pattern that is sometimes seen and sometimes not as the accretion disk spins. Another possibility is that the stellar remains are driving shock waves that move slowly through material surrounding the black hole, which produce energetic emissions at later times, though no one really knows. But given that these incidents now seem to last longer than originally suspected, Horesh is looking forward to being able to detect more tidal disruption events that could yield insights into their nature. Dai, too, is excited about the prospect of opening up ways to study the mysteries of TDEs. \"These events are ideal laboratories to learn about black holes,\" she said, giving researchers important clues about how material accretes around them and produces jets and flares. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, which is expected to begin collecting data this year, could theoretically see hundreds of new TDEs, she added; and other upcoming space-based instruments from Europe and China should add to this bounty. \"The future for the field is very bright,\" she said.

       "  'Full Article': 'Scientists have identified more than 70,000 previously unknown viruses that live in the human gut and infect the bacteria that live there  — but how they impact our bodies is a mystery. The gut microbiome, or the community of microbes that we carry around in our digestive system, plays an important role in food digestion and regulating the immune system, Live Science previously reported. But many studies have also linked imbalances in gut microbes to conditions including liver disease, obesity and allergies. Yet shockingly little is known about the microbiome. Although the microbiome includes a variety of microorganisms — including bacteria and viruses — previous studies have focused mainly on gut bacteria because they are easier to detect. Related: 5 ways gut bacteria affect your health In the new study, a group of researchers used a method called metagenomics to identify the viruses. This method involves analyzing all of the genetic material from a community of microbes together and then mapping the individual sequences found to specific species. They analyzed more than 28,000 gut microbiome samples taken from 28 countries. This process revealed complete genomes for more than 140,000 species of viruses living in the human gut. (A single person, however, carries around only a fraction of these species.) Though many types of viruses live in the gut, they focused on viruses that can infect bacteria, called \"bacteriophages\" or \"phages\" for short. The researchers limited their scope to bacteriophages because \"we are still figuring out their role in human health,\" said lead author Luis Camarillo-Guerrero, a recent PhD graduate from the Wellcome Sanger Institute in the U.K. \"It\\'s probably safe to say that the vast majority of them are not harmful to us and are simply an integral component of our body microbiota.\" Phages may play a central role in the gut microbiome  — for instance, by providing their bacterial hosts with advantageous traits and influencing how those bacteria evolve. — 10 amazing things we learned about humans in 2018 — Going viral: 6 new findings about viruses — The 12 deadliest viruses on Earth \"As bacterial communities are a critical component of our gut, it\\'s not difficult to imagine that phages could be paying a key role in maintaining a healthy equilibrium in our intestine,\" Camarillo-Guerrero told Live Science in an email. However, there are known cases when phages have contributed to disease; for example, both diphtheria, a serious bacterial infection, and botulism, a serious illness that attacks the body\\'s nerves, are caused by toxins that are encoded by phage genes. They published the genomes of these bacteria-invading viruses in a new database they created called the \"Gut Phage Database,\" which can be used to guide further studies on these viruses, Camarillo-Guerrero said. \"A genome is like the blueprint of an organism,\" he said. \"The amount of information that we can extract from knowing only the DNA sequence of an organism is very large.\" The findings were published Feb. 18 in the journal Cell.

       "  'Full Article': 'Two spacewalking astronauts began preparing the International Space Station (ISS) for new solar arrays on Sunday (Feb. 28), battling tough bolts to kick off a major power upgrade for the orbiting lab. Expedition 64 flight engineers Kate Rubins and Victor Glover — both NASA astronauts — spent more than seven hours working outside the station during the spacewalk to install modification kits for the new solar arrays. They worked on the station\\'s portside edge to install a bracket and support struts on two mast canisters at the base of the outpost\\'s current solar wings there, but were only able to install one of the kits while assembling a second and storing it for later. \"They completed the construction of upper support hardware and secured it to the space station’s exterior structure until work can be completed on the next spacewalk on Friday, March 5,\" NASA officials said in an update. Related: Spacewalking astronauts complete a space station battery upgrade The ISS, parts of which have been in orbit since 1998, is getting ready for new solar panels. NASA says the oldest set of panels have been operating continuously since December 2000, and are still doing well despite their advertised 15-year service life. (The other pairs were delivered in September 2006, June 2007 and March 2009.) But the arrays don\\'t generate as much power as they used to, hence a series of spacewalks beginning now. The new arrays will be smaller than the old ones due to advances in solar technology. They will be installed to roll out in front of the six current arrays, allowing the new installations to use the infrastructure already in place for the existing set, according to NASA. Boeing (the prime contractor for space station operations) will provide the arrays, with the help of its subsidiary Spectrolab and a major supplier, Deployable Space Systems.  The spacewalkers\\' goal was to install new array support structures to the station\\'s  4B and 2B using a solar arrays modification kit and several tools, which came in a huge bag about 8 feet (2.5 meters) long, and 1 foot (0.3 m) wide and deep. Rubins and Glover hauled the kit and solar array struts for their work towards the right edge of the station, using a special \"slingshot\" device to use crew safety tethers far from the core of the ISS. \"Unfortunately, this mod kit is very large, and it doesn\\'t fit out the door in its current state,\" said spacewalk officer Art Thomason in a news conference held Wednesday (Feb. 24). \"So we have to bring it out in pieces, kind of like assembling furniture.\" Thomason noted that the mass of the equipment is roughly 330 lbs. (150 kilograms), and the crew members will need to be cautious while bringing everything to the far edges of the space station, where the solar arrays are located. \"Even though we don\\'t have gravity to deal with in space, we still have inertia and mass. The crew knows to be careful with this,\" he said. \"As they\\'re translating [moving] out there, they\\'re going to take it easy and make sure when they\\'re turning corners, and things like that, they help guide the bag because this is a larger thing than what they\\'re used to.\" Related: International Space Station at 20: A photo tour The crew hoped to install two sets of struts at two worksites nearby the solar arrays, Thomason said. At each site, they were to use a portable foot restraint and tethers to anchor in place, before installing a left strut, a right strut and a midstrut. The astronauts planned to secure thermal blankets over each of the struts. Rubins also carried a new high-definition video camera on her spacesuit, a first for U.S. spacewalks, to provide clearer views. In practice, however, the Glover and Rubins fell behind schedule after one of the bolts on the first strut did not fully engage at first. \"One of the bolts did not fully engage on the first attempt, so Rubins used a power drill to back it out and reseat it, then used a ratchet wrench to tighten the bolt, reaching a safe configuration,\" NASA officials wrote in the update. \"The bolt likely will need to be secured further before installing one of the new solar arrays that will be delivered to the space station later this year aboard SpaceX’s 22nd commercial resupply services mission.\" The astronauts then managed to assemble the upper support for the second set of arrays, then secured it to their worksite so it can be installed on an upcoming spacewalk on March 5. Rubins and Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi will venture outside the station on that next excursion, which is expected to complete the work begun in today\\'s spacewalk. It will also include a bundle of maintenance tasks: venting ammonia, removing and replacing a wireless video transceiver assembly, and installing a \"stiffener\" on the thermal cover of the Quest airlock to stop the cover from blowing out during spacewalks (when some residual air from the space station escapes into space.) For that excursion, Rubins will be EV 1 and Noguchi EV 2. Solar arrays naturally degrade over time and the new array set will boost station current power levels by 20% to 30%, bringing the ISS back up to about what was available when the orbiting laboratory was first constructed decades ago, NASA said in a statement. (Batteries are also a factor in station power, especially for storage capabilities; spacewalking crews spent about four years upgrading the older batteries to newer and more efficient versions, finally completing that work in January.) The eight solar arrays now in place provide about 160 kilowatts of power; half of that is stored for when the station is in orbital darkness, which occurs about 15 times a day. Once the new solar arrays are in place over the old ones, adding the new array power to what remains of the older arrays should provide up to 215 kilowatts of power, depending on factors such as whether the station is in sunlight or darkness, NASA said. \"The solar arrays will be delivered to the International Space Station in pairs in the unpressurized trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft during three resupply missions starting in 2021, when the second pair of current arrays reaches the 15th year of its design life,\" NASA added in the statement. \"The installation of each solar array will require two spacewalks: one to prepare the worksite with a modification kit and another to install the new solar array.\" Solar array 4B has an interesting history. Back in 2007, astronauts on the space station and a space shuttle were deploying the newly delivered array when they noticed a tear developing. They stopped the deployment and consulted NASA\\'s Mission Control in Houston for a fix. The result was an epic spacewalk — the procedures for which were implemented in mere days — that saw astronaut Scott Parazynski spacewalking atop the Canadarm2 robotic arm and an extension piece for a repair. Parazynski used tools crafted in orbit to carefully sew together the tear in the fully powered array. The tricky work of Parazynski, his crewmates and ground controllers that November allowed the damaged array to finish deploying. The fix is still in place today.

The call, which NASA and the White House released on YouTube Saturday (Feb. 27), came amid Black History Month, as Glover is midway through a six-month flight to the space station. He is the first Black astronaut to fly a long-duration mission to the station. \"Victor, it is so great to see you,\" an excited Harris said in the 3-minute video. \"The history-making you are doing, we are so proud of you.\" Related: Astronaut Victor Glover explains why we can\\'t always just stick to space  Glover, 44, launched to the space station in November alongside three other astronauts as part of SpaceX\\'s Crew-1 mission for NASA. He is part of the station\\'s seven-person Expedition 64 crew and is making his first spaceflight since joining NASA\\'s astronaut corps in 2013. Harris, who is the first woman and woman of color elected as vice president, asked Glover what he thought about his own achievement as the first African-American astronaut to fly a long-duration mission to the space station. The astronaut said his flight was only possible because of the astronauts and cosmonauts who came before him to bring humanity to its current point in space exploration. On April 12, the world will mark 60 years of human spaceflight. The first person to fly in space, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, launched on that day in 1961. \"I really appreciate that legacy and I try to do my best to honor it,\" Glover said. \"I think about right now, it is a time that we should celebrate and be appreciative of the current state of human spaceflight.\" \"But really what I\\'m most excited about is the future of human spaceflight and the fact that this is going to be the future, this is what we\\'re going to do for the foreseeable future,\" Glover added. \"So yeah, that was a first. but it won\\'t be the only time that that\\'s happened.\" Harris agreed. \"My mother would say to me, \\'Kamala, you may be the first to do many things, but make sure you\\'re not the last,\\'\" she said.

An ISRO Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) carried Amazonia-1 and 18 smaller satellites into space using a \"DL\" variant that has two strap-on boosters, ISRO said in a description of the mission. \"The satellite is in very good health,\" ISRO Chairman K. Sivan said after the launch. \"The solar panels have deployed and it is functioning very nicely.\" In photos: India launches the RISAT-2B Earth-imaging satellite  Amazonia-1 is optimized to peer at the cloud-covered region of its namesake, the Amazon forest, since it has infrared capabilities that allow it to look at the forest cover regardless of the weather. Brazil plans to use the satellite for \"alert deforestation\" in the region, Brazil\\'s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) said in an Amazonia 1 mission description. The satellite is also Brazil\\'s first independently designed, built and operated satellite, which country officials hailed after it reached orbit. \"This satellite has a very important mission for Brazil,\" said Marcos Pontes, Brazil\\'s minister for science, technology and innovation, who is also the country\\'s first astronaut (he flew to the International Space Station in 2006). \"It represents a new era of the Brazilian industry for satellite development in Brazil.\" Deforestation is an ongoing concern not only for the region\\'s unique flora and fauna, which are irreplaceable once extinct, but also for health outcomes of human residents. Back in August 2019, smoke from wildfires in the Amazon transformed São Paulo\\'s normal daylight hours into a smog-filled afternoon of darkness, amid a larger state of emergency in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. The 18 other satellites include a mix of Indian and American craft. The Indian-built satellites include Satish Dhawan SAT (which studies radiation, space weather and communications), the UNITYsat trio (for radio relay) and a technology demonstrator satellite called SindhuNetra.  The American ones include another technology demonstrator called SAI-1 NanoConnect-2, and 12 \"SpaceBees\\'\\' from Swarm Technologies, part of a larger constellation the company is building in low Earth orbit. The PSLV launch was the first of 2021 and the third flight ever of the PSLV-DL variant, ISRO said in its mission statistics. The PSLV has made over 53 flights overall, in all variants.

       "  'Full Article': 'On a weekly basis, we’ll be sending you into the weekend with a selection of news and conversations that have the Space.com Forums buzzing! This week, the community was left in awe at all the images and sounds coming to us from NASA\\'s Perseverance rover. We also shared some of our favourite memories involving space. Finally, we look to the future of space exploration technology.  Since that eventful first landing in the Jezero crater, we’ve been sharing our excitement at the Mars thread. Here are some of our favourite contributions: IMO the most important thing beyond all else conceivable is the possibility of finding evidence of extraterrestrial life. My firm belief is that we are not alone and finding evidence of past life so close would be indicative of widespread occurrence. Of course, there is a yearning cavern between primitive life and ourselves, but extraterrestrial life, once established in principle, might eventually show how primitive we are, despite our grand anthropomorphic delusions. - Catastrophe Really really cool how the actual footage was almost identical to the animated version! - Eukaryote Is the rover capable of flying autonomously? I can\\'t wait to see the pictures. I hope NASA will fly the rover over Cydonia Mense or the Valles Marineris. What a site that would be. - DAF Join the conversation here. All this talk about the images makes you wonder: what about the sound of being on Mars? We got our answer not long after Perseverance landed. Equally important was the answer to another question: what would that sound like in a song? Senior Writer Chelsea Gohd provided us with a memorable answer. How does it sound, you ask? One community member, vincenzosassone, put it best: Only one word: beautiful. Listen for yourself here. As space enthusiasts, we all have a memory or two that reminds us why the great beyond is so fascinating. We asked the community what some of their favourites were: I\\'d say my favorite space memory was the US Return to Space following the Challenger accident. I remember exactly where I was when Discovery lifted off on the 29th of Sept, 1988. I had joined the Air Force a year earlier. I was in my office with most of my entire squadron gathered around a 6\" portable TV screen, watching the launch. My heart was racing as Discovery lifted off and it all but stopped when I heard the five scariest words I\\'ve ever heard: \"Discovery. Go with throttle up.\" 30 seconds later, my eyes were full of tears and I had a fist raised in triumph. - Wolfshadw Going down to Florida as a kid, about five years before the first Shuttle launch. It was soon after the Soyuz-Apollo docking and I got a big medal souvenir medallion/coin commentating it. I actually got quite a bit of swag on my dad’s dime :) Those were great days, I miss my mom and dad. - GeoXXX My favorite space memory would have to be the first trip to the moon. It was a leap ahead for mankind and opened up infinite possibilities. It opens up questions of the possibility of other inhabitable planets and other lifeforms. The stars have always fascinated me. - Special K Check out the rest of the conversation here. The last few weeks have inspired the community to test their imaginations and wonder about the future of space exploration. Specifically, what barrier will space technology break next? While I don\\'t expect it any time soon, I would like to see the issues with Artificial Gravity (Centripetal Force) be resolved. Just one of many issues facing long term space flight. - Wolfshadw I liked the way microsatellites are developing and how they partially substitute ordinary sats. This is a cheaper and easier way for some missions ordinary sats used to do. Also, we may use microsats bigger number of fields that only emphasize their competence. Satellite technology takes part in our everyday lives, so we cannot imagine our present world without sat technology. - serhiy1635 Questioning a solar eclipse. Naming a planet.

Well, sort of. Most of the time, the full moon isn\\'t perfectly full. We always see the same side of the moon, but part of it is in shadow. Only when the moon, Earth and the sun are perfectly aligned is the moon 100% full, and that alignment produces a lunar eclipse. And sometimes — once in a blue moon — the moon is full twice in a month (or four times in a season, depending on which definition you prefer). This month\\'s full moon occurs this weekend on Sunday, Mar. 28 at 2:48 p.m. EDT (18:48 UTC), but the moon will appear full the night before and after its peak to the casual stargazer.

The names were applied to the entire month in which each occurred. The Farmer\\'s Almanac lists several names that are commonly used in the United States. There are some variations in the moon names, but in general, the same ones were used among the Algonquin tribes from New England on west to Lake Superior. European settlers followed their own customs and created some of their own names. Other Native American people had different names. In the book \"This Day in North American Indian History\" (Da Capo Press, 2002), author Phil Konstantin lists more than 50 native peoples and their names for full moons. He also lists them on his website, AmericanIndian.net. Amateur astronomer Keith Cooley has a brief list of the moon names of other cultures, including Chinese and Celtic, on his website. For example, Chinese moon names:  Full moon names often correspond to seasonal markers, so a Harvest Moon occurs at the end of the growing season, in September or October, and the Cold Moon occurs in frosty December. At least, that\\'s how it works in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, where the seasons are switched, the Harvest Moon occurs in March and the Cold Moon is in June. According to Earthsky.org, these are common names for full moons south of the equator.

It also takes about 27 days for the moon to rotate on its axis. So, the moon always shows us the same face; there is no single \"dark side\" of the moon. As the moon revolves around Earth, it is illuminated from varying angles by the sun — what we see when we look at the moon is reflected sunlight. On average, the moon rises about 50 minutes later each day, which means sometimes it rises during daylight and other times at night. At new moon, the moon is between Earth and the sun, so that the side of the moon facing toward us receives no direct sunlight, and is lit only by dim sunlight reflected from Earth. A few days later, as the moon moves around Earth, the side we can see gradually becomes more illuminated by direct sunlight. This thin sliver is called the waxing crescent. A week after the new moon, the moon is 90 degrees away from the sun in the sky and is half-illuminated from our point of view — what we call first quarter because it is about a quarter of the way around Earth. A few days later, the area of illumination continues to increase. More than half of the moon\\'s face appears to be getting sunlight. This phase is called a waxing gibbous moon. When the moon has moved 180 degrees from its new moon position, the sun, Earth and the moon form a line. The moon’s disk is as close as it can be to being fully illuminated by the sun, so this is called full moon. Next, the moon moves until more than half of its face appears to be getting sunlight, but the amount is decreasing. This is the waning gibbous phase. Days later, the moon has moved another quarter of the way around Earth, to the third quarter position. The sun\\'s light is now shining on the other half of the visible face of the moon. Next, the moon moves into the waning crescent phase as less than half of its face appears to be getting sunlight, and the amount is decreasing. Finally, the moon moves back to its new moon starting position. Because the moon’s orbit is not exactly in the same plane as Earth’s orbit around the sun, they rarely are perfectly aligned. Usually the moon passes above or below the sun from our vantage point, but occasionally it passes right in front of the sun, and we get an eclipse of the sun. Each full moon is calculated to occur at an exact moment, which may or may not be near the time the moon rises where you are. So when a full moon rises, it’s typically doing so some hours before or after the actual time when it’s technically full, but a casual skywatcher won’t notice the difference. In fact, the moon will often look roughly the same on two consecutive nights surrounding the full moon. Additional resources:',\n",

       "  'Title': \"February full moon 2021: See the 'Snow Moon' with Mars this weekend\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'The full moon of February, called the Snow Moon, will occur in the eastern U.S. during the wee hours of Saturday, Feb. 27, at 3:17 a.m. EST (0817 GMT). Early risers will see Mercury at its highest point in the predawn sky. In New York City moonrise is at 5:02 p.m. local time the evening of Feb. 26, and moonset is the next morning at 7:05 a.m., according to timeanddate.com. The sun sets the evening of Feb. 26 at 5:44 p.m. That means the almost-full moon will be in the sky before sunset — looking east from mid-northern latitudes one will see the moon just rising as the sun goes down. As one goes further south the time of moonrise gets later; in Miami the moon rises the evening of Feb. 26 at 5:52 p.m. and sets on Feb. 27 at 7:12 a.m. The sun and moon will still be in the sky together at sunset, but for slightly less time than in New York — the sun sets in Miami on Feb. 26 at 6:21 p.m., so both will be visible for 29 minutes as opposed to 42 minutes in New York. Related: The moon: 10 surprising lunar facts  Meanwhile, in Melbourne, Australia, the moon is full on Feb. 27 at 7:17 p.m. local time, and doesn\\'t rise until 8:23 p.m. The sun will set that day at 8:02 p.m., so mid-southern latitudes will not see the sun and almost-full moon in the sky at the same time. The full moon happens when the moon is exactly on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun. The timing of lunar phases is the same all over the world, the differences are due to time zones. When the moon rises and sets depends on latitude and season; just like the sun, the full moon will cross the sky at a different altitude in summer and winter. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter full moons tend to be relatively high in the sky, whereas in the summer they are lower. The reverse is true in the Southern Hemisphere. This is related to why some people on Earth can see the full moon in the sky at the same time as the sun (if at sunset) and some cannot. The Earth\\'s rotational axis is tilted about 23.5 degrees from the vertical; this tilt is why we have seasons. In the Northern Hemisphere winter that means nights get longer. So even though the sun and moon are exactly 180 degrees apart (as measured from Earth along the plane of its orbit, known as the ecliptic) the angle measured across the sky parallel to the horizon can be less than that (or more, if one is in the Southern Hemisphere). Related: Infinite loop: See the sun\\'s yearlong figure-eight in the sky (photo) • 2021 Full Moon Calendar • Full Moon Names for 2021 • Moon Phases Infographic Binoculars or a small telescope will make the full moon appear so bright that a lot of detail can get washed out. The brightness isn\\'t dangerous to one\\'s eyes, but using a filter is sometimes a good idea to help spot surface details. The issue is the lack of shadows to give contrast — we are seeing the lunar surface at noontime on the moon, so the sun (from the perspective of a person standing on the moon) is directly overhead. If one waits a few days after the full moon or observes a few days before, shadows bring out more detail. Being in the constellation Leo, the lion, the moon will be between the star Regulus, the brightest in that constellation, and Denebola, the second-brightest. When the moon reaches its highest point in the sky, shortly after midnight on Feb. 27, it will be 62 degrees above the southern horizon. As the moon rises the first (and only) planet to become visible will be Mars. Shining at a magnitude of 0.9 it will be in the south-southwest at sunset, but it will take about a half hour to become visible. By 6:30 p.m., however, it should be one of the first bright \"stars\" to show itself (a good exercise is to see how soon after sunset one can catch it). The planet will be high; some 63 degrees above the horizon in New York, and it will set there at 12:20 a.m. local time on Feb 27. On the morning of Feb. 27, Mercury rises at 5:24 a.m. in New York, and it will be at its highest in the morning sky (for Northern Hemisphere sky watchers), according to In-The-Sky.org. It will still be a challenge to observe, as the sun rises at 6:32 a.m. The planet will only reach 11 degrees in altitude above the southeastern horizon when day breaks.  Mercury will form a triplet of sorts with Jupiter and Saturn. About a half hour before sunrise, as seen from New York, the two giants of our solar system will be \"framing\" Mercury, with Saturn higher up (about 7 degrees) and Mercury to the Saturn\\'s left. Jupiter will be only about 3 degrees above the horizon and below and to the left of Mercury. By sunrise, Saturn will be about 12 degrees high and Jupiter about 9 degrees. Once again, antipodeans have the advantage. Observers in Melbourne, Australia will see Saturn rise first, at about 4:34 a.m. local time on Feb. 27, followed by Mercury at 4:59 a.m. and Jupiter at 5:13 a.m.; sunrise is at 7:02 a.m. About 30 minutes before sunrise Saturn will be 23 degrees high and nearly due east. Mercury will appear almost directly below it at 18 degrees, and Jupiter will be below and to the right of Mercury at about 15 degrees. All three planets — especially Jupiter and Saturn — will be bright enough that they should be visible even as the fainter stars fade. The full moon tends to overwhelm fainter stars, but it will share the sky with bright winter constellations that are still visible. During February Taurus, the bull will be high in the south at sunset. It\\'s brightest star is Aldebaran, which will be to the left of the planet Mars. Both are identifiable by a distinct reddish hue, though Aldebaran is a bit more orange-yellow. Just below Taurus is Orion, the hunter, and to its left is the constellation of Gemini, the twins. Looking south (below and slightly to the left) from Orion is Canis Major, the big dog, home to Sirius, the brightest star in the sky. Mid-southern latitude sky watchers, meanwhile, will see an \"upside down\" Orion and Taurus in the northwest, with Aldebaran to the right and above Mars. The Southern Cross near the meridian just after sunset, and below it will be Centaurus, home to Alpha Centauri, the closest star to our solar system. The Southern Cross and Centaurus are both in the Milky Way, and as you turn your attention towards the zenith (the point directly overhead) you will see the constellations of Puppis, Vela and Carina, the three constellations — the deck, sail and hull — that make up the Argo, the ship. According to the Ontario Native Literacy Project, the Anishinaabe peoples called the February full moon Mkwa Giizis, the Bear Moon. The Cree called it the Kisipisim, or the Great Moon. The Tlingit of the Pacific Northwest call the February full moon S\\'eek Dís, or Black Bear Moon, while the Haida called it Hlgit\\'ún Kungáay, or \"Goose moon,\" according to the Tlingit Moon and Tide Teaching Resource published by the University of Alaska at Fairbanks. In the Southern Hemisphere, February is during the summer, and the Māori of New Zealand described the lunar month in February to March (as measured between the successive new moons, with the full moon halfway between) as Poutū-te-rangi or \"the crops are now harvested,\" according to the Encyclopedia of New Zealand. In China, the traditional lunar calendar calls the February lunation the first month, Zhēngyuè (正月, \"start month\") and it is when the traditional Chinese Lunar New Year is celebrated (the New Year begins on the day of the new moon, the full moon is halfway through the month). For Muslims, the February 2021 lunation (starting with the new moon on Feb. 13) marks the start of Rajab, the seventh month and a time in which battles are prohibited. On the Jewish Calendar the February lunation is the month of Adar, and on the 14th day, which would be close to the full moon, Jews celebrate Purim. (The Gregorian calendar date is sunset on Feb. 25 to sunset on Feb. 26). Purim commemorates the rescue of the Jewish people from Hamam, a 5th century BCE Persian official who had planned to kill all the Jews in the Empire but was foiled by Esther, as recounted in the Biblical book of the same name.

       "  'Title': 'Mysterious stripes spotted over Russia in satellite images — and NASA is perplexed',\n",
       "  'Full Article': \"Near the Markha River in Arctic Siberia, the earth ripples in ways that scientists don't fully understand. Earlier this week, NASA researchers posted a series of satellite images of the peculiar wrinkled landscape to the agency's Earth Observatory website. Taken with the Landsat 8 satellite over several years, the photos show the land on both sides of the Markha River rippling with alternating dark and light stripes. The puzzling effect is visible in all four seasons, but it is most pronounced in winter, when white snow makes the contrasting pattern even more stark. Why is this particular section of Siberia so stripy? Scientists aren't totally sure, and several experts offered NASA conflicting explanations. Related: Earth's 8 biggest mysteries One possible explanation is written in the icy ground. This region of the Central Siberian Plateau spends about 90% of the year covered in permafrost, according to NASA, though it occasionally thaws for brief intervals. Patches of land that continuously freeze, thaw and freeze again have been known to take on strange circular or stripy designs called patterned ground, scientists reported in a study published in January 2003 in the journal Science. The effect occurs when soils and stones naturally sort themselves during the freeze-thaw cycle.  However, other examples of patterned ground — such as the stone circles of Svalbard, Norway — tend to be much smaller in scale than the stripes seen in Siberia. Another possible explanation is erosion. Thomas Crafford, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, told NASA that the stripes resemble a pattern in sedimentary rocks known as layer cake geology. These patterns occur when snowmelt or rain trickles downhill, chipping and flushing pieces of sedimentary rock into piles. The process can reveal slabs of sediment that look like slices of a layer cake, Crafford said, with the darker stripes representing steeper areas and the lighter stripes signifying flatter areas. The 11 biggest volcanic eruptions in history\\nThe world's weirdest geological formations\\n7 ways Earth changes in the blink of an eye In accordance with the image above, this sort of sedimentary layering would stand out more in winter, when white snow rests on the flatter areas, making them appear even lighter. The pattern fades as it approaches the river, where sediment gathers into more uniform piles along the banks after millions of years of erosion, Crafford added. This explanation seems to fit well, according to NASA. But until the region can be studied up close, it'll remain another one of those quintessentially Siberian curiosities.

       "  'Full Article': 'Update for 12:25 a.m. EST, Feb. 28: The India Space Research Organisation has successfully launched the Amazonias-1 Earth observation satellite for Brazil. Read our wrap story here. India will send a Brazilian Earth-observation satellite to space along with 18 additional satellites — and you can watch the launch live. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will launch the satellite, called Amazonia-1, on a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle that will lift off from the country\\'s Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. ISRO will broadcast the launch live website starting at 11:20 p.m. EST Saturday, Feb. 27 (0420 GMT or 9:50 a.m. local time at the launch site on Sunday, Feb. 28). The launch is scheduled for 11:54 p.m. EST Saturday (0454 GMT or 10:24 a.m. local time Sunday). You can watch the launch live here or directly on Space.com, courtesy of ISRO. You can also watch it directly from ISRO here and via YouTube. Crowds will not be allowed at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, ISRO noted in a separate press release; there will be no media personnel or launch viewing available due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. India didn\\'t launch a mission last year until November because of the pandemic\\'s impact. In photos: India launches the RISAT-2B Earth-imaging satellite The mission\\'s lead satellite is Brazil\\'s Amazonia 1, which will operate in a sun-synchronous polar orbit so the instruments will fly over consistent lighting conditions. The satellite will be able to view any part of Earth within five days and can observe in both visual and infrared bands, with resolution of about 200 feet (60 meters). Infrared imaging allows spacecraft to peer through clouds, which will be \"extremely valuable in applications such as [monitoring] deforestation in the Amazon,\" Brazil\\'s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) said in an Amazonia 1 mission description. \"It increases the probability of capturing useful images in the face of cloud cover in the region,\" the institute added. Amazonia-1 and 18 satellite companions will launch on the popular Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle \"DL\" rocket variant, which uses two solid strap-on boosters, ISRO said in a description of the mission. The smaller \"co-passengers\" are from India and the United States. The Indian satellites include Satish Dhawan SAT (which will study radiation, space weather and communications), the UNITYsat trio for radio relay and a technology demonstrator satellite called SindhuNetra, about which ISRO has not provided details. The American satellites include another technology demonstrator called SAI-1 NanoConnect-2, as well as 12 \"SpaceBees\" from Swarm Technologies, part of a larger constellation that will use two-way satellite communications and data relay for the Internet of Things. Swarm paid a $900,000 fine to the Federal Aviation Administration in 2018 following an unauthorized launch of SpaceBees, but the company has sent more satellites into space since without issue.

Related: Here\\'s the last thing NASA\\'s Opportunity rover saw before \\'lights out\\' The ESA-Roscosmos orbiter arrived at Mars five years before Perseverance, on Oct. 19, 2016. Its scientific instruments sample and analyze molecules in the Martian atmosphere, so that scientists can better understand how atmospheric gases that appear in very small quantities, such as methane, may signal biological or geological activity on distant planets, according to the ESA. ExoMars also carries cameras, and its Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS) photographed Perseverance from an altitude of approximately 249 miles (400 kilometers). The image is a snapshot of all the stages that took Perseverance through its descent, after the spacecraft shed its cruise stage. The backshell, a small white dot in the far left of the photo, fired small thrusters during the initial descent to keep Perseverance on course, according to NASA. Next to the backshell in the image is another white dot: Perseverance\\'s parachute. It deployed when the rover slowed to less than 1,000 mph (1,600 km/h). Once the parachute opened, the heat shield separated and dropped to the ground; that shield is visible in the photo as a dark speck on the far right. – 5 Mars myths and misconceptions – Voyager to Mars rover: NASA\\'s 10 greatest innovations – Space oddity: 10 bizarre things Earthlings launched into space Perseverance jettisoned the parachute next, firing engines in the descent stage.

It shows up in the photo as a dark speck about halfway between the rover, and the parachute and backshell. \"The orbiter will continue to provide data-relay support between Earth and Mars for NASA\\'s surface missions,\" the ESA statement said.

       "  'Full Article': 'A giant iceberg, more than 20 times the size of Manhattan, just split off from Antarctica\\'s Brunt Ice Shelf. This dramatic breakup comes after a major crack formed on the shelf in November 2020 and continued to grow until the \\'berg finally broke off Friday morning (Feb. 26). The so-called \"North Rift\" crack is the third major chasm to actively tear across the Brunt Ice Shelf in the last decade, and so scientists with the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) were absolutely expecting the split. \"Our teams at BAS have been prepared for the calving of an iceberg from Brunt Ice Shelf for years,\" Dame Jane Francis, the director of the BAS, said in a statement. \"Over [the] coming weeks or months, the iceberg may move away; or it could run aground and remain close to Brunt Ice Shelf.\" (Icebergs are pieces of ice that have broken off from glaciers or ice shelves and are now floating in open water, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). Related: Photos: diving beneath Antarctica\\'s ross ice shelf The North Rift crack grew toward the northeast at a rate of about 0.6 miles (1 km) per day in January; but on the morning of Feb. 26, the crack widened a couple hundred meters in just hours. This ice split happened due to a natural process, and there\\'s no evidence that climate change played a role, according to the statement. The Brunt Ice Shelf, a 492-foot-thick (150 meters) slab of ice, flows west at 1.2 miles (2 km) per year and routinely calves icebergs. This iceberg, however, happened to be very big, with an estimated size of about 490 square miles (1,270 square km). \"Although the breaking off of large parts of Antarctic ice shelves is an entirely normal part of how they work, large calving events such as the one detected at the Brunt Ice Shelf on Friday remain quite rare and exciting,\" Adrian Luckman, a professor at Swansea University in Wales who was tracking the shelf through satellite images in the last few weeks, told the BBC.  The Brunt Ice Shelf is home to the BAS Halley VI research station, where scientists observe atmospheric and space weather; but the station will likely not be affected by this splitting, according to the statement. Related: Photos: Behind the scenes of an Antarctic research base\\'s relocation In 2016, the BAS relocated the station 20 miles (32 km) inland to avoid the two other major cracks in the ice shelf known as \"Chasm 1\" and the \"Halloween Crack,\" both of which haven\\'t widened any further in the past 18 months, according to the statement. — 50 amazing facts about Antarctica — Life on the edge: photos from drilling the ross Ice Shelf — In photos: Antarctica\\'s larsen C ice shelf through time The research station is now closed for winter, and the 12-person team left Antarctica earlier in February. Because of the unpredictability of iceberg calving, and the difficulty of evacuating during the dark and frigid winters, the research team has been working at the station only during the Antarctic summer over the past four years. More than a dozen GPS monitors measure and relay information about ice deformation of the shelf back to the team in the U.K. every day. The researchers also use satellite images from the European Space Agency, NASA and the German satellite TerraSAR-X to monitor the ice. \"Our job now is to keep a close eye on the situation and assess any potential impact of the present calving on the remaining ice shelf,\" Simon Garrod, the BAS director of operations, said in the statement.

       "  'Full Article': 'NASA\\'s Perseverance rover isn\\'t just exploring the Red Planet. The life-hunting robot will also help a little bit of Mars make it to Earth a decade or so from now, if all goes according to plan. Perseverance, the centerpiece of NASA\\'s $2.7 billion Mars 2020 mission, touched down inside the Red Planet\\'s Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021. Once it\\'s fully up and running, the car-sized robot will search for evidence of past microbial life and collect  several dozen samples for future return to Earth, among other ambitious tasks. \"I don\\'t think we\\'ve had a mission that is going to contribute so much to both science and technology,\" NASA Acting Administrator Steve Jurczyk told Space.com shortly before Perseverance touched down. \"It\\'s going to be truly amazing.\" More: Where to find the latest Mars photos from Perseverance Join our forums here to discuss the Perseverance rover on Mars. What do you hope finds? If Perseverance looks familiar, that\\'s because the robotic explorer is largely based off its predecessor, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover, which landed in August 2012 and is still going strong today. Like Curiosity, the Perseverance rover was built by engineers and scientists at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Roughly 85% of Perseverance\\'s mass is based on Curiosity \"heritage hardware,\" saving NASA time and money and reducing risk considerably, agency officials have said. Perseverance is about 10 feet long (not including its robotic arm), 9 feet wide, and 7 feet tall (about 3 meters long, 2.7 meters wide and 2.2 meters tall). At 2,260 lbs. (1,025 kilograms), Perseverance weighs less than a compact car. Like Curiosity, Perseverance has a rectangular body, six wheels, a robotic arm, a drill for sampling rocks, cameras and scientific instruments. But those instruments are quite different than the gear aboard Curiosity, because the two rovers have divergent goals. Curiosity\\'s main task involves assessing the habitability of ancient Mars, whereas Perseverance will hunt for evidence of ancient Martians. Perseverance\\'s seven instruments \"build on the success of MSL, which was a proving ground for new technology,\" said George Tahu, NASA\\'s Perseverance program executive. \"These will gather science data in ways that weren\\'t possible before.\"             Perseverance also used the same entry, descent and landing (EDL) strategy as Curiosity. Both rovers hit the Mars atmosphere at tremendous speeds, deployed a supersonic parachute after friction slowed them down enough, and were finally lowered gently to the red dirt on cables by a rocket-powered \"sky crane.\" But Perseverance had some EDL upgrades that Curiosity did not enjoy. For example, NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which manages the Mars 2020 mission, developed new landing technology called terrain-relative navigation. As the rover descended through the Martian skies, it used a computer to compare the landscape with pre-loaded terrain maps, guiding itself to a safe landing site and making corrections on the way down. Another new feature, known as range trigger, used location and velocity information to determine when to open the supersonic parachute, narrowing the landing ellipse by more than half. \"Terrain-relative navigation enables us to go to sites that were ruled too risky for Curiosity to explore,\" said JPL\\'s Al Chen, Perseverance\\'s EDL lead. \"The ranger trigger lets us land closer to areas of scientific interest, shaving miles — potentially as much as a year — off a rover\\'s journey.\" Perseverance rover\\'s Mars landing: Everything you need to know Perseverance boasts nearly five times more cameras than the first Mars rover. Sojourner, which landed in 1997, carried only five cameras, and the twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which hit the red dirt in 2004, had 10 cameras apiece. Curiosity has 17. Perseverance has 23 cameras. Several of them filmed the rover\\'s Mars arrival, capturing its landing in historic and unprecedented detail. The epic EDL video shows Perseverance\\'s parachute snap open in the Martian sky, for example, and documents the moment the robot\\'s six wheels hit the red dirt. \"For those who wonder how you land on Mars, or why it is so difficult, or how cool it would be to do so — you need look no further,\" Jurczyk said in a statement a few days after touchdown. \"Perseverance is just getting started and already has provided some of the most iconic visuals in space exploration history,\" he added. \"It reinforces the remarkable level of engineering and precision that is required to build and fly a vehicle to the Red Planet.\"  Some of Perseverance\\'s cameras provide more color and 3D imaging than Curiosity can collect, according to Jim Bell of Arizona State University, the principal investigator for Perseverance\\'s Mastcam-Z camera system. \"Z\" stands for \"zoom,\" one of the improvements on Curiosity\\'s high-definition Mastcam. Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity have all captured 1-megapixel images in black and white with their engineering cameras, which assist in drive planning and hazard avoidance. But Perseverance\\'s engineering cameras acquire high-resolution, 20-megapixel color images. Their wider field of view means that, instead of spending time taking multiple images to be stitched together on the ground, the new cameras capture the same view in a single snapshot. The cameras also reduce motion blur, so they can take photos while the rover is traveling. More detailed images mean more data to beam through space. \"The limiting factor in most imaging systems is the telecommunications link,\" said Perseverance imaging scientist Justin Maki of JPL, the instrument operations team chief. \"Cameras are capable of acquiring much more data than can be sent back to Earth.\" Related: Perseverance rover snaps gorgeous HD panorama of Mars  Smarter rover cameras are helping to reduce the load. On Spirit and Opportunity, photo compression was done using the onboard computer. On Perseverance, as on Curiosity, compression is performed by electronics built into the camera. Perseverance\\'s data is beamed back to Earth via several spacecraft orbiting Mars: NASA\\'s Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution), and the European Space Agency\\'s Trace Gas Orbiter. Odyssey was the first orbiter to send rover data home from Spirit and Opportunity. \"We were expecting to do that mission on just tens of megabits each Mars day, or sol,\" Bell said, referring to Spirit and Opportunity\\'s work. \"When we got that first Odyssey overflight, and we had about 100 megabits per sol, we realized it was a whole new ballgame.\" Mastcam-Z is one of Perseverance\\'s seven science instruments. Another, known as SHERLOC (\"Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals\"), will be the first instrument on Mars to use Ramen and fluorescence spectroscopies, techniques familiar to forensics experts. When an ultraviolet light shines over certain carbon-based chemicals, they glow much like material beneath a black light. The glow can help scientists detect chemicals that form in the presence of life. SHERLOC will photograph the rocks it studies, then map the chemicals it detects across the images. \"This kind of science requires texture and organic chemicals — two things that our target meteorite will provide,\" Rohit Bhartia of JPL, SHERLOC\\'s deputy principal investigator, said in a statement. The space rock mentioned by Bhartia is the Martian meteorite Sayh al Uhaymir 008 (SaU008), which the team will use to help calibrate SHERLOC. Previous rovers have included calibration targets, but none of them have ever relied on Martian meteorites. (A meteorite has, however, ridden to Mars aboard the Mars Global Surveyor, which ceased operations in January 2007.) More: 5 weird things NASA\\'s Perseverance rover took to Mars Another Perseverance instrument, called PIXL (\"Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry\"), will determine the composition of Martian materials at a very fine scale using a high-resolution camera and X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. The rover\\'s SuperCam instrument, an evolution of Curiosity\\'s ChemCam, will zap target rocks with lasers and determine the chemical composition of the resulting vapor. Perseverance also carries a ground-penetrating radar instrument called RIMFAX (\"Radar Imager for Mars\\' Subsurface Experiment\"). RIMFAX will be the first rover instrument ever to look under the surface of Mars, mapping layers of rock, water and ice up to 33 feet (10 m) deep. Also aboard the rover is a weather station known as MEDA (\"Mars Environmental Data Analyzer\") and a technology demonstration called MOXIE (\"Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment\"). MOXIE is designed to generate oxygen from the Red Planet\\'s atmosphere, which is 95% carbon dioxide by volume. Such gear, if scaled up, could help humanity get a foothold on the Red Planet in the future, NASA officials have said. (The agency aims to put boots on Mars in the 2030s.) SHERLOC, PIXL and Perseverance\\'s rock drill sit at the end of the rover\\'s 7-foot-long (2.1 m) robotic arm, which can move with five degrees of freedom. MEDA, MOXIE and RIMFAX are on Perseverance\\'s body, and Mastcam-Z and SuperCam are on the rover\\'s headlike mast. Perseverance also carries two microphones, to relay the sounds of the Red Planet back to Earth. One is part of the EDL camera system, and the other is built into SuperCam. The mission team hoped the EDL mic would record sound during Perseverance\\'s touchdown. That didn\\'t happen, but the instrument did switch on shortly after landing, collecting the first-ever true audio on the surface of Mars. (Two other NASA Mars missions, the Mars Polar Lander and Phoenix lander, carried microphones, but neither of them returned any audio data. Mars Polar Lander crashed in December 1999, and Phoenix\\'s mic was never turned on, out of concern that it could interfere with the spacecraft\\'s May 2008 touchdown.) Listen to the Mars wind blow in these 1st sounds from the Perseverance Hearing these otherworldly sounds helps bring Mars down to Earth for all of us, making the Red Planet a more accessible place, mission team members have said. And Mars audio has more than just gee-whiz appeal. \"There\\'s a lot of good science that can be done by having a microphone on Mars,\" SuperCam team member Sylvestre Maurice, a planetary scientist at the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology in France, told Space.com. For example, once SuperCam comes online, the mic should help reveal how hard target rocks are and whether or not they have a coating. Martian audio will also improve our understanding of the Red Planet\\'s thin atmosphere, by providing data to plug into models, mission team members have said. It\\'s possible that Perseverance will even gather stereo sound on the Martian surface, by operating the EDL and SuperCam mics in concert. Perseverance also carried a tiny hitchhiker to Mars — a 4-lb. (1.8 kg) helicopter named Ingenuity, which will attempt to make the first-ever rotorcraft flights on a world beyond Earth. Like MOXIE, Ingenuity is a technology demonstration; it carries a high-resolution camera but no science instruments. If the little chopper does manage to get off the Martian ground, helicopters could become a staple of Red Planet exploration in the future, gathering a variety of data on their own and/or serving as scouts for rovers, NASA officials have said. Ingenuity will get its chance soon. Once Perseverance gets fully up and running, the mission team will find a suitable airfield and let the helicopter fly. The rover will attempt to document these flights from a safe distance, using its cameras and microphones.  Spirit and Opportunity were solar powered. Both rovers far outlived their three-month warranties, roaming the red desert for years. But they both ultimately succumbed to the elements, freezing to death after finding themselves in situations where their solar panels couldn\\'t soak up enough sun. (NASA declared Spirit and Opportunity dead in 2011 and 2019, respectively.) Curiosity and Perseverance don\\'t have to worry about Martian sunlight levels. The big rovers are nuclear powered, each sporting a roughly 100-lb. (45 kg) Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG). These MMRTGs convert to electricity the heat naturally produced by the radioactive decay of plutonium-238. And they keep doing so for a long time; the MMRTG has an operational life of 14 years, according to NASA\\'s Mars 2020 information page. Curiosity is still going strong inside Mars\\' Gale Crater, more than eight years after touching down. So there\\'s every reason to believe that Perseverance\\'s power source, and its other vital components, will allow the robot to keeping roaming beyond the rover\\'s prime mission duration of one Mars year, or about 687 Earth days.  Perseverance launched from Florida\\'s Space Coast on July 30, 2020, hurtling into space atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. Getting off Earth is never easy, and Perseverance had a particularly challenging path.  The mission team had to conduct the final assembly and testing procedures, and the launch itself, while the coronavirus pandemic raged around them. Like the rest of us, many Perseverance team members had to adapt to working from home; key rover prep was done from living rooms, kitchens and backyard patios. And getting the robot to the launch pad on time — a high priority, since launch windows for Mars missions open for just a few weeks once every 26 months — was far from a foregone conclusion. \"In March and early April [2020], we weren\\'t sure we were going to be able to make it,\" Jurczyk told Space.com. (Back then, the NASA administrator was Jim Bridenstine, and Jurczyk led the agency\\'s Space Technology Mission Directorate.) \"But we were able to work through the planning and get there. It\\'s a real credit to the dedication and hard work of the team.\" Perseverance\\'s deep-space journey went smoothly, and the rover arrived at Mars as planned, 6.5 months after liftoff. The pandemic was still an issue on landing day, however; rover team members assembled at mission control at JPL to oversee EDL on Feb. 18, but they wore masks and practiced social distancing to the extent possible. In a harrowing \"seven minutes of terror,\" the rover plunged into the Martian atmosphere, jettisoned its heat shield and deployed the largest parachute ever built for Mars to slow its descent to the Martian surface. Cameras on the rover, its sky crane and backshell captured the descent down to the ground, including the moment the sky crane, hovering over the Martian surface, lowered Perseverance to the ground for a picture perfect landing. The Perseverance rover landed safely on Mars and began surveying its Jezero Crater home.        In February 2017, a team of scientists narrowed the Mars 2020 landing-site candidates down to three finalists: Columbia Hills, Northeast Syrtis and Jezero Crater. One site had been explored before. Starting in 2004, the Spirit rover roamed through Gusev Crater and Columbia Hills, where the robot discovered evidence of past water, the only place it found water in the enormous crater. Later data analysis suggested that the crater may have once hosted a shallow lake. An ancient volcano in Northeast Syrtis could have generated hot springs and melting ice, creating the ideal conditions for past microbial life, researchers have said. The edge of the Syrtis Major volcano exposes 4-billion-year-old bedrock, as well as many minerals altered by volcanic activity during the Red Planet\\'s early history. The 28-mile-wide (45 km) Jezero Crater, meanwhile, is an ancient lakebed where microbial life could have developed, NASA officials said in a statement. Jezero also harbors the remains of a long-gone river delta, whose structure suggests that water filled and drained from the site at least twice. MRO has also spotted minerals at the site that have been chemically altered by water. In November 2018, NASA announced the final selection: Perseverance will explore Jezero Crater. \"The landing site in Jezero Crater offers geologically rich terrain, with landforms reaching as far back as 3.6 billion years old, that could potentially answer important questions in planetary evolution and astrobiology,\" Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, said in a statement at the time. \"Getting samples from this unique area will revolutionize how we think about Mars and its ability to harbor life,\" he added. It\\'s possible that Perseverance will spot convincing signs of ancient life on the Martian surface — something akin to a fossilized stromatolite here on Earth, perhaps. That\\'s a tall order for a lonely robot on a faraway world, however, so it\\'s more likely that the rover\\'s life-hunting data will be suggestive at best, mission team members have said. But Perseverance will allow scientists to get much better and more detailed looks at promising samples — by kicking off humanity\\'s first-ever Mars sample-return campaign. The rover will drill at least 20 rock cores, and possibly even 30 to 40. This Mars material will be secured in special sample tubes and deposited at select locations for retrieval by a joint NASA-European Space Agency campaign. \"The belly of the rover houses all the equipment and supplies needed to collect samples. It contains a rotating drill carousel, which is a wheel that contains different kinds of drill bits,\" NASA officials wrote in a description of Perseverance\\'s pioneering sample-collecting hardware. \"While the rover\\'s big arm reaches out and drills rock, the rover belly is home to a small robotic arm that works as a \\'lab assistant\\' to the big arm,\" they added. \"The small arm picks up and moves new sample tubes to the drill, and transfers filled sample containers into a space where they are sealed and stored.\" If all goes according to plan, the samples will get to Earth as early as 2031. Scientists around the world will then use powerful instruments to search them for signs of life and clues about Mars\\' long-ago transition from a relatively warm and wet world to the cold desert planet it is today. Such work will continue for decades; after all, scientists are still studying the moon rocks brought home by NASA\\'s Apollo astronauts half a century ago. \"Mars sample return is the planetary science endeavor of our generation,\" Bobby Braun, director of solar system exploration at JPL, said during a pre-landing NASA news conference on Feb. 17. \"It\\'s ambitious. It\\'s challenging. It\\'s a scientifically compelling goal that, over decades, we have been working toward,\" Braun said. \"And it\\'s right there. It\\'s just within our reach.\"  NASA let schoolkids name the Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity rovers via a nationwide competition, and the agency continued this tradition with Mars 2020. The winning name was nominated by Virginia seventh-grader Alex Mather and announced in March 2020. Mather\\'s essay submission ends like this: \"We are a species of explorers, and we will meet many setbacks on the way to Mars. However, we can persevere. We — not as a nation but as humans — will not give up. The human race will always persevere into the future.\" Perseverance is an especially apt name for the rover, given that the Mars 2020 team   had to deal with a global pandemic in the leadup to launch, NASA officials said. \"Yes, it\\'s curiosity that pulls us out there, but it\\'s perseverance that does not let us give up,\" Zurbuchen told reporters shortly after the name was announced. \"There\\'s no exploration without perseverance.\" Alabama high schooler Vaneeza Rupani submitted \"Ingenuity\" for the rover-naming contest. NASA officials liked that moniker so much that they gave it to the mission\\'s helicopter. \"It took a lot of hard and ingenious work to get the helicopter ready and then placed on the rover, and there\\'s a lot more going to be required,\" Bridenstine said in an April 2020 statement. \"I was happy we had another great name from the naming contest finalists from which I was able to select something so representative of this exciting part of our next mission to Mars.\" Follow Nola Taylor Redd on Twitter @NolaTRedd or Facebook.

       "  'Title': \"How did NASA's Martian rover come to land in a crater named after a tiny Balkan village?\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'This article was originally published at The Conversation. The publication contributed the article to Space.com\\'s Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights. Robert Greenberg, Dean of Arts, University of Auckland The world was excited by the news last week that NASA\\'s Perseverance rover had successfully landed in a Martian crater. The rover will now set about collecting samples from what scientists say was an ancient lake fed by a river. The name of this exotic Martian crater is Jezero. As a South Slavic linguist, I immediately recognised the word. In several former Yugoslav countries, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia, \"jezero\" (pronounced \"yeh-zeh-ro,\" with the stress on the first syllable) means lake. Fair enough — but why a Balkan lake on Mars? The task of providing names for places of interest on Mars falls to the International Astronomical Union (IAU). They apparently named the Martian crater Jezero in 2007, well before earthlings had paid any attention. I later discovered the name was not, in fact, intended simply as a generic \"lake,\" but refers to a specific village called Jezero. With a population around 500, it is located in western Republika Srpska, the Serb-dominated part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is very near a river-fed lake called Veliko Plivsko Jezero, or Great Plivsko Lake. According to the Balkan Insight news service, the mayor of Jezero first learned of NASA\\'s plans in a letter from the US ambassador in Bosnia and Herzegovina, informing her the village and its name were to be honored by the spacecraft landing in the Jezero crater.  The villagers apparently first dismissed this as fake news. But, to their later amazement, people all over the world have now been learning to pronounce Jezero properly. The landing was broadcast live at the village\\'s only school, with the Balkan Insight reporter describing the villagers as \"star-struck\" and justifiably proud of their connection to the mission. There was also cautious optimism about the prosperity that might flow from tourists discovering their sleepy hamlet (at least after the pandemic). Famous on Mars, might Jezero be celebrated on Earth as well? The alternative to be avoided, one hopes, is that a minor Balkan conflict breaks out over language and designated names. Every one of the former Yugoslav countries can claim the word \"jezero\" in their respective dictionaries. And any traveller to the Balkans knows the region is rich with lakes. But only one village carries this generic word as its name. Was it politically advisable for one village in the Serb-dominated entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina to be singled out? For many, this part of the country is still associated with the nationalism and ethnic cleansing of the Bosnian war in the 1990s. Read more: \\'7 minutes of terror\\': a look at the technology Perseverance will need to survive landing on Mars How would the members of other communities in the country — Bosniaks (the country\\'s Muslim population) and Croats — respond? Could they support the Serbs of Jezero receiving such positive media coverage? As my book about the break-up of the Serbo-Croatian language explored, language rifts in the Balkans are endemic and have long been both a symptom of ethnic animosity and a cause for inflaming it. Will people quibble over whether the crater is named for the village or for its nearby lake, or any lake within the region? Or should all who say \"jezero\" feel proud the word is now in the global lexicon?  During the time of Tito\\'s rule in Yugoslavia, such matters would not have been as contentious, since many people believed the dominant common language of the country was Serbo-Croatian. Ethno-nationalism was forbidden and people mostly got along. However, since the violent break-up of Yugoslavia, people in the newly independent states now speak separate languages: Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian. Read more: Remembering Srebrenica, more than 20 years on Over the years, speakers of the four languages have slowly drifted apart, but they all agree a lake is called \"jezero\". Further complications arise with peoples and governments even further afield. The Slovenes and Czechs also say \"jezero,\" and the Macedonian and Bulgarian form is the almost identical \"ezero\". Any similarity between the landscape around Jezero in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the crater with the same name on Mars may end with the name. And I doubt the scientists at NASA or the IAU ever considered the potential implications of using a common word shared by so many nations to name an important site on Mars. But, as we know, words have power. It would be a shame if a distant, silent crater on another planet caused envy and resentment here on Earth. So far, however, the political situation in the Balkans remains almost as calm as that on Mars, and that is cause for hope.

James Scott, Associate Professor in Geology, University of Otago NASA’s Perseverance rover successfully touched down on Mars Feb. 18, and has already begun beaming back images. Hello, world. My first look at my forever home. #CountdownToMars pic.twitter.com/dkM9jE9I6XFebruary 18, 2021 But people might be surprised to learn there have been another 48 missions to the red planet so far. Of these, more than half failed at stages from take-off to deployment — including the 1999 Mars Climate Orbiter, destroyed on Mars entry after someone failed to convert imperial measurements to metric. Successful missions include Mars Insight, which is studying the interior via measurement of “marsquakes”, and the Curiosity rover, which touched down in 2012 and has been examining the geology of Mt Sharp. Epic video: Watch the Perseverance rover land on Mars\\nLive updates: NASA\\'s Perseverance Mars rover mission Although there have been no return missions, there is a lot we can learn without travelling to Mars — from the more than 260 Martian meteorites that have fallen on Earth. Read more: As new probes reach Mars, here\\'s what we know so far from trips to the red planet Images taken by orbiters reveal Mars has more than 40,000 craters, each formed by an asteroid colliding with the surface. You can explore these craters yourself by going to Google Earth, toggling the Google Mars mode and zooming in. If some of the debris from the large impacts reached escape velocity (about 5 km/s on Mars), it would be able to leave the planet’s gravitational field. Eventually, some of the ejected Martian material has intercepted Earth’s trajectory, flashing through the atmosphere until it either burned up or came to rest on the surface. Although Martian meteorites have been found across Earth, most have been collected from Antarctica or the deserts of northwest Africa. In both cases, the black crust that forms as the meteorite partially burns up passing through Earth’s atmosphere stands out clearly against ice or sand. This mode of interplanetary travel is important because it raises the possibility that life could inadvertently travel from one planet to another. Back in 1996, one Martian meteorite, ALH84001, was controversially thought to contain fossilized bacteria. Some of the older landers have almost certainly taken Earth bacteria to Mars, since they were not purified before launch. Small planets cool quickly and it has long been suspected that Mars’s core has largely but not totally crystallised. This means Mars has mostly lost the protective magnetic field that deflects cosmic radiation. But we are confident Mars once had an ocean, containing water as we know it. The temperature was above freezing and conditions were suitable for life. The stripping away of the magnetic field early in Mars’s history means this ocean is long gone and the average temperature is now -65℃, but frosts, clouds and ice caps remain.  Not being fortunate enough to roam the deserts of Africa or the icy plateaus of Antarctica, I instead found my first Martian meteorite sitting in a cabinet in a gem store in the small New Zealand town of Akaroa. Using a scanning electron microscope, my examination revealed it was a shergottite, one of the most common Martian meteorites — equivalent to what we know on Earth as basalt. If it’s basalt, though, how do we know it\\'s from Mars? There are several ways of recognizing a Martian meteorite. One is from its gas content. When a meteorite strikes the surface of Mars, the \"target\" rocks are subject to such great pressures they partly melt and trap Martian atmosphere within gas bubbles. Some of these rocks are then ejected from the planet — becoming meteorites themselves. The gases in these meteorites can be measured back on Earth and compared to the known Martian atmosphere, which comprises 95% carbon dioxide and distinct noble gas concentrations. The thousands of craters scarring Mars\\' surface mean it is ancient. This was confirmed when one meteorite was dated to be 4.4 billion years old. Properties of some other Martian meteorites show Mars formed within 13 million years of the formation of the Solar System. This in turn means some of the first planetary crust that formed on Mars likely still exists at the surface. This inference, along with some meteorite mineral and isotopic properties, implies Mars has not been shaped by plate tectonics — the global process that formed the continents, mountain ranges and ocean basins on Earth. And, as most dated Martian meteorites are less than 1.5 billion years old, volcanism has continued throughout its history. Mars may be cold but it is not dead. Martian meteorites also hold clues about how people may one day be able to survive on the planet. While living in hollowed out lava tubes in Martian basalt may appeal to some hopeful interplanetary settlers, we’ll ultimately need to build shelters to protect us from the cosmic radiation and vast dust storms that engulf the planet. Martian meteorites show olivine, a magnesium-silicate mineral, is common. Experiments are underway to assess the use of a breakdown component, magnesium carbonate, to form a concrete binder from which we could fashion buildings. Martian meteorites show that big insights can be gleaned from little rocks and reveal what Mars is made of. This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

       "  'Full Article': 'China successfully sent three reconnaissance satellites into orbit Tuesday (Feb. 23), according to media reports. A Long March 4C rocket carrying the Yaogan-31 satellites flew into space from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert at 9:22 p.m. EST (0222 GMT, or 10:22 a.m. local time Wednesday, Feb. 24), according to a report from China\\'s state news provider CCTV. \"Having entered their planned orbits, the satellites will be used for electromagnetic environment surveys and other related technology tests,\" CCTV added in the short report. Video: Blastoff! China launches trio of Yaogan-31 reconnaissance satellites\\nRelated: China is planning to launch at least 3 rockets from the sea this year  Western defense analysts have suggested the Yaogan series is meant for the People\\'s Liberation Army for uses such as surveillance, intelligence or reconnaissance that — considering their orbits — may be similar to satellites that track vessels through radio transmissions, according to Space News. The satellites may include capabilities to study targets in optical wavelengths or synthetic aperture radar, and could carry electronic intelligence payloads, Space News added. Past launches put the Yaogan satellites at orbits of roughly 680 miles (1,100 kilometers) in altitude and inclined by 63 degrees, passing over maritime regions such as the South Shetland Islands. This is the third clutch of Yaogan satellites to launch from China. The second group went to space just a few weeks ago, on Jan. 28, according to contractor China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. The first group reportedly launched in April 2018 in similar orbits, allowing China to shorten the time between when a particular region is visible under the growing constellation. China has had a busy February in space, including the successful arrival of Tianwen-1 in Mars orbit and preparation for a Mars landing, reports that its first space station module is preparing for a flight, and ongoing examinations of rocks on the lunar far side by the Yutu 2 rover and Chang\\'e 4 lander. About a month ago, a launch by China\\'s iSpace failed to reach orbit. Follow Elizabeth Howell on Twitter @howellspace. Follow us on Twitter @Spacedotcom and on Facebook.',\n",

       "  'Title': \"NASA hosts ceremony renaming headquarters building for 'Hidden Figure' Mary Jackson\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'NASA commemorated Mary Jackson, one of the agency\\'s \"Hidden Figures,\" today (Feb. 26) during a ceremony renaming the agency\\'s headquarters after her. During the ceremony, agency leaders acknowledged the historical barriers that African-Americans and Blacks have faced at NASA and elsewhere, as well as the systemic inequalities that persist today for BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and people of color) communities. Jackson joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the predecessor of NASA, during the height of segregation in the U.S. She became NASA\\'s first Black engineer in 1958. She was unable to advance far in her career and instead used her energies to mentor other Black women to help them go even further than her, several NASA officials said. Related: Why \\'Hidden Figures\\' is a movie everyone should watch  Her death in 2005 preceded the new interest in NASA\\'s Black history spurred by the movie and book \"Hidden Figures,\" released in 2016, which finally brought a group of Black women who helped fuel NASA\\'s early history into the spotlight. The renaming of The Mary W. Jackson NASA Headquarters building was announced in June 2020. \"There is no denying that she faced innumerable challenges in her world that would eventually help send the first Americans to space,\" acting administrator Steve Jurczyk said during the Feb. 26 ceremony in Washington, D.C., which was broadcast on NASA TV. He acknowledged \"heartfelt and genuine\" conversations that he and other NASA officials have had with the Black community since he took the role of acting administrator in January; those conversations \"have given me an appreciation for the challenges that Americans face, and what we need to do,\" he said/ Jurczyk added he is committed to continuing to address barriers for NASA employees of diverse backgrounds and that \"we\\'re going to work on that for the rest of our lives.\" The ceremony, held with attendees in masks due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, included luminaries such as fellow \"Hidden Figure\" Christine Darden, Jackson\\'s grandchildren, and artist Tenbeete Solomon, also known as Trap Bob. Numerous dignitaries, largely from the Black community, gave speeches or sent their best wishes or memories of Jackson through prerecorded video.  \"Her example will guide us together as we raise to new heights for the benefit of humankind,\" said Clayton Turner, director of NASA\\'s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, which is roughly three hours south of the newly named NASA headquarters. Turner, who is Black, told attendees at the D.C. ceremony that Jackson \"used her success to help countless others to follow in her footsteps.\" Jackson graduated from Hampton Institute in Virginia in 1942 with a dual degree in math and physical sciences. After taking a job as a math teacher, she worked as a bookkeeper and served as a secretary for the Army before joining the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory (today, the Langley Research Center that Turner leads) in 1951. Jackson was subsequently recruited by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) to work as a \"human computer\" in the segregated West Area Computing Unit at Langley. Her pioneering work in supersonic aircraft and commercial aircraft at NACA and NASA is still being referred to today, Jurczyk said. Jackson\\'s granddaughter, Wanda Jackson, recalled talking to her grandmother about one of her major accomplishments: helping to design the space shuttle. The elder Jackson downplayed what she did. \"She never gloated about any of her accomplishments or anything she did. It was who she was, everyday life,\" Wanda Jackson said. The renaming ceremony concluded several weeks of programming at NASA to commemorate Black History Month. February also saw the launch of the S.S. Katherine Johnson, a Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ship, to the International Space Station. A Black NASA astronaut, Victor Glover, is currently undertaking the first long-duration flight by an African-American on the orbiting complex. Other astronaut milestones in Black history at NASA include the first flight of an African-American astronaut, made by Guion Stewart Bluford Jr. in 1983, the first flight of an African-American female astronaut, Mae Jemison\\'s mission in 1992, and the first spacewalk by an African-American, conducted by Bernard Anthony Harris Jr. in 1995.

       "  'Title': 'Virgin Galactic further delays SpaceShipTwo test flights, pushing tourist flights to 2022',\n",
       "  'Full Article': ' Virgin Galactic won\\'t be launching tourists to space this year after technical tweaks delayed the company\\'s upcoming test flight by more than two months. During a fourth-quarter earnings call reporting financial results from 2020 held on Thursday (Feb. 25), company representatives announced that Virgin Galactic will be delaying the next test flight for its SpaceShipTwo suborbital vehicle to likely May to take care of technical issues, according to SpaceNews. The delay will push the company\\'s first space tourist flights to 2022. Regarding the upcoming test flight, company officials cited needed technical changes to the vehicle revealed by the Dec. 12 aborted suborbital test flight of the vehicle, which was caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI), according to SpaceNews. Virgin Galactic officials said that EMI caused a flight computer to reboot at the same time that SpaceShipTwo\\'s engine ignited. There were no injuries to the vehicle\\'s two pilots during the aborted flight, and the vehicle landed safely. Related: How Virgin Galactic\\'s SpaceShipTwo works (infographic) After the incident, an investigation revealed that a new flight control computer system likely caused the increased EMI that triggered the abort. Virgin Galactic planned for a follow-up test flight to occur as early as Feb. 13. But after trying to fix the issue, company engineers noted continuing EMI issues and decided to once again delay, using the time to modify the computer that is creating the interference and test the new system before attempting another flight. \"We saw some of our sensor readings — pressures and temperatures, those kinds of things — show some unusual fluctuations, which let us know EMI was still present and maybe in systems we didn\\'t initially anticipate,\" Virgin Galactic president Mike Moses said on the call, according to SpaceNews. Following these updates and testing with the new system, Virgin Galactic plans to get the vehicle off the ground for this test flight in May, followed by two more test flights. The first of those additional flights will hold only the two pilots, while the second will include Virgin Galactic employees riding along as test passengers in the vehicle\\'s cabin. These test flights will be followed by a fourth flight for the Italian Air Force, which will carry research payloads along with payload specialists. The company expects these flights to take place this summer, Virgin Galactic CEO Michael Colglazier said on the call, according to SpaceNews. The company also announced on the call that it will be rolling out the next iteration of its suborbital vehicle, dubbed SpaceShip III, on March 30. Following this rollout, the company aims to start flight testing the vehicle in the summer, at the same time as SpaceShipTwo. \"The Future of the Fleet. Rollout, March 30th,\" Virgin Galactic tweeted yesterday (Feb. 25) along with a promo image of what appears to be the vehicle. The Future of the Fleet.Rollout, March 30th. pic.twitter.com/Y6Y3NvNTDpFebruary 25, 2021 Following these tests, the company will \"implement enhancements and accelerate some long-term maintenance updates\" to the WhiteKnightTwo aircraft, also known as VMS Eve, which carries both suborbital vehicles up into the air, Colglazier said on the call, according to SpaceNews. Then, it will be time for paying customers to step aboard, he said. \"At the conclusion of this period, we expect that VSS Unity will begin flying private astronauts and SpaceShip III will be in a position to complete its flight testing, which we expect to be in early \\'22,\" Colglazier added. Despite the continued delays, for which representatives partially placed blame on the coronavirus pandemic, the company is excited about the year ahead. \"Looking ahead, we\\'re focused on completing our test flight program, expanding our fleet of spaceships and motherships, and developing our unique and transformative customer experience,\" Colglazier said about the company\\'s 2020 progress in a press release following the call.

       "  'Title': 'Q&A: Private astronaut Richard Garriott set to dive to lowest point on Earth',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Richard Garriott thought he would have been there and back by now. The son of a NASA astronaut and a video game pioneer who funded his own trip to the International Space Station in 2008, Garriott was set to dive to Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, the lowest point on Earth, in June, just days after another space explorer, NASA\\'s Kathy Sullivan, became the first astronaut and the first woman to do so. But then a call came the night before Garriott\\'s departure. \"I was crushed because they had a major mechanical failure,\" Garriott told Space.com, \"nothing that was dangerous for the crew or the submarine, but it was an electrical system, a junction box on the exterior that they really wanted at 100% before they dove any more. So that meant taking the entire submarine and ship back to Hawaii to remanufacture a couple of parts and retest those couple of extra parts. And now we\\'re back in business, so I\\'m going to be the first dive on this sequence.\" Photos: Private space traveler Richard Garriott, a \\'man on a mission\\' Garriott is now scheduled to begin the 12-hour dive aboard the \"Limiting Factor,\" the first commercially certified full-ocean-depth deep submergence vehicle, on Monday (March 1). An avid adventurer and the president-elect of the venerable The Explorers Club, Garriott is set to become the first person to orbit Earth, travel to the deepest part of the ocean and traverse both poles of the planet. \"I have been to space and I\\'ve been to both the North and South poles. So even though Kathy beat me going space to deep, she has not been to both poles. So, I will be the first male to go space to deep, and the first person to go who has traversed Earth as well as the deep,\" Garriott said. \"Not that you have to agree that any of that matters, which of course, fundamentally, it doesn\\'t really, but it\\'s kind of fun.\" Space.com spoke with Garriott the night before he departed for the \"Pressure Drop,\" the surface-side modified U.S. Navy ship that will support his dive near Guam in the Western Pacific Ocean. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Space.com: Are you making the 12-hour dive alone? Richard Garriott: The total dive time is 12 hours. It\\'s four hours to the bottom, four hours exploring the bottom and four hours to return to the surface. I\\'m diving with Victor Vescovo, who underwrote the build of the \"Limiting Factor\" and also served as Kathy Sullivan\\'s pilot. I am also traveling with my exploration partner, a guy named Michael Dubno. He is a good friend of mine; we build automatons together. We\\'ve dangled over lava pits in Nicaragua, we have been to the North Pole together and now we\\'re headed to the deep together. [Dubno will dive separately from Garriott, following him the bottom of the ocean a couple of days later, as currently scheduled.]  Space.com: You are not just going down to sightsee and set records. What do you have planned for the four hours you will be at the bottom? Garriott: We have a pretty heavy science regimen on our dive series. We have science that the team behind the ship, the \"Limiting Factor,\" has set up and then science that we are doing with some other university labs. The Mariana Trench is created by the collision between the Pacific plate and the Philippine Sea plate, with the Pacific plate being subducted below the Philippine plate. We\\'re going to try to get a geological sample from both sides of the subduction zone because, first, they should be strikingly different geology and secondly, these are rocks that are about to disappear forever. So these should be ancient, well-protected samples from both plates. Then, in my trips to the Antarctic and the Arctic and hydrothermal vents and volcanoes, we have brought back samples in which we have found extremophile lifeforms. And so in the deep we expect to find right at the bottom of the trench what are called piezophiles, which are high-pressure extremophiles that have never been sampled down there. On this last summer dive series, they [the crewmembers] believe they saw bacterial mats, but they didn\\'t have the ability to sample them. That\\'s something that has been sort of my specialty with a lot of the exploring that I\\'ve done, so I\\'m very eager to try to get that sample back. And then also for the Scripps Institute, we\\'re going to be looking for microplastics. This is something that Mike and I did when we took a bunch of young explorers to the North Pole and sadly found them everywhere. Scripps has studied every open environment, every natural environment and has found that all had microplastics. So with both deep-water samples, as well as deep-mud samples, we anticipate that we will find a significant load of plastics. In photos: Sea life thrives at otherworldly hydrothermal vent system  Space.com: Beyond that, you have also planned some activities on the opposite end of the spectrum, the arts. Is that correct? Garriott: In fact, it is actually one of the things that I\\'m weirdly most excited about and which has been wildly successful. Like I did when I flew in space, we\\'re taking lots of questions from kids. The kids are putting in pictures that I\\'m going to take into the deep and stamp them and answer the questions and then bring them all back and send it back to those kids. Then we also had the director of the National Association for Teaching English, who suggested a fascinating challenge and that was to ask kids to think about this trip and about the extreme environment and the tiny little 1.5-meter [5-foot] titanium sphere that we will be sitting in and think about the fact that because of the extremes of this environment, we can\\'t take anything in that little sphere with us that is not absolutely essential for life support or science. And so he said, why don\\'t we have kids write a poem called a cinquain, which is a five-line poem of only 22 syllables and a very specific number of syllables per line — two, four, six, eight, two, to be specific. And that way, they have to think very carefully about not just every word that goes into it, but literally every syllable that you put into this little poem. So we put out a challenge for kids to do this, and not only have we received now hundreds and hundreds from all over Europe, but also all over the United States and all over Asia and all the way down to New Zealand. Really from all over. I\\'m taking them all down with me and when we get back to the surface, I\\'ll stamp them all with a Challenger Deep stamp and sent them all back. Space.com: Are you taking any personal items with you? Do you have anything that previously traveled with you to the poles and to space that you\\'re now taking down to Challenger Deep? Garriott: There actually is one thing that I\\'m taking that has been all those places, which is a children\\'s book that I have taken with me on all of my explorations since I was young. It\\'s titled \"Hubert\\'s Hair Raising Adventure\" and I actually took it on my first safaris in Africa when I was just out of college. I took it up to space and I took it to both poles. And now I will be taking it to the deep as well. I also have a Lego submarine that I made when I was about eight years old. I super glued it together because I was using it in the bathtub. It\\'s made so I could put batteries and a motor in it and I could drive it around in my bathtub. So that was something I really had to take with me and my cinquain goes: My sub Once was Lego Now it\\'s titanium From bathtub to Challenger Deep We dive.  Space.com: That\\'s awesome. Anything else you\\'re taking? Garriott: We actually created a couple of personal experiments that I think are really quite interesting. There is a concept called hydroforming where they use water pressure, usually with an explosive behind it, to basically mint a coin in a sense. So we thought, well, we\\'re going to have natural pressure on the outside [of the submersible] that is monstrous, so why don\\'t we make a die like you might stamp a coin with and we\\'ll put a thin sheet of metal across the surface of it, and we\\'ll let the natural water pressure at the depths form the thin metal around the die. So we\\'re taking this 3-inch-diameter [7.6 centimeters], two-sided die with these clamp rings on it that we can put 10 sheets of brass or copper on and hopefully hydroform. We\\'re going to send that down on every dive in our series and hope to come back with these little minted things we\\'ve created with natural pressure. And then, after setting the highest geocache in the world, which is on the International Space Station, we\\'re going to set the deepest one. We\\'ve cut a 6-inch-square [15 cm] titanium plate that not only has the geocache number written on it, which is still hidden until we make it public in a week or so, and it has a secret word written on it. And we have a syntactic foam float that rises up on a Kevlar tether, which also has the word \"geocache\" and the geocache number on it. Then, on the opposite sides of the syntactic foam, which is kind of a downward facing arrow, is the secret word. And so the secret word is in four places on this thing. So that way, anybody that happens to see this again in the future therefore will have seen the secret word and will have a chance to find this geocache as well. Space.com: Lastly, have you spoken to Kathy Sullivan? Did she share any advice given her own dive and your shared spaceflight experience? Garriott: Kathy\\'s advice was invaluable. In addition to the scientific and human aspects and observational aspects of the trip, I had some really practical questions, like you\\'re sitting in a chair for 12 hours and that\\'s a similar length of time that we had to sit in a space capsule in a spacesuit without having to move. And there\\'s these little things like in the space capsule that you wear an adult diaper just for this occasion. So we covered all kinds of important subjects.

       "  'Title': \"Q&A: Astronaut Garrett Reisman guest stars on 'For All Mankind'\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Garrett Reisman was reviewing the script for an episode of \"For All Mankind\" when he came across a familiar name. A veteran NASA astronaut who has served as a technical consultant for the Apple TV+ series since it began, Reisman was used to seeing some of his fellow space explorers being played by actors in the context of the show\\'s alternate history. \"For All Mankind\" imagines what might have happened to the U.S. space program if the Soviets had been first to land a human on the moon in the 1960s. This casting was different, though. Now in its second season, the series\\' storyline has moved into the space shuttle-era of the early 1980s, closer to when Reisman — in real life — became part of the U.S. space program. Related: Astronaut-led video tour reveals details in \\'For All Mankind\\' moon base Spoiler warning: What follows contains minor spoilers for \"The Bleeding Edge,\" Episode 2 in Season 2 of \"For All Mankind.\" \"So I\\'m poring through the script for episode two and I see there\\'s a character in there named \\'Garrett Reisman\\' and I wasn\\'t sure what that meant,\" Reisman said. \"Maybe they were just going to name a character after me as a nice nod and have that character be played by a professional actor.\" But Reisman noticed that the part wasn\\'t very big; it was nothing like the extended scenes that portrayed Mercury astronaut Deke Slayton in the first season or European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Wubbo Ockels as seen in the first episode of Season 2. Suspecting something was up, Reisman reached out to the show\\'s executive producers. \"\\'Hey, I see this character, \\'astronaut Garrett Reisman.\\' Where are you possibly going to find an actor handsome enough to play that role?\\'\" joked Reisman, he recalled. As it turns out, they already had the perfect candidate for the part. collectSPACE.com spoke with the real-life astronaut Garrett Reisman about his cameo appearance in \"For All Mankind,\" now streaming on Apple TV+. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  collectSPACE (cS): Had you asked for a cameo, or whose idea was it to insert you, as you, into the show? Garrett Reisman: It was something that executive producers Ben Nedivi and Matt Wolpert just decided to do. I think in Season 1 there was a thought about putting my name on a mission patch, but they said, \"No, no, we\\'ve got a better idea. We\\'re going to do something in Season 2.\" Ben and Matt wrote the script for Episode 2, so I\\'m pretty sure it was their idea to throw me in front of the camera, which I told them was a horrible, horrible mistake. cS: You play the commander of space shuttle Columbia, ferrying Ockels (Bjørn Alexander), Ellen Wilson (Jodi Balfour) and Molly Cobb (Sonya Walger) home from the Jamestown moon base. What was it like playing a space shuttle astronaut, given you launched twice on the real shuttle? [Reisman logged more than 100 days in space flying on two missions, including a stay on board the International Space Station in 2008.] Reisman: It was funny. I remember after one cut, Matt Wolpert came up to me and said, \"You know, I\\'m just not believing it. You don\\'t seem like a real astronaut.\" People go to Space Camp so that they can pretend that they\\'re an astronaut for a bit. Well, I kind of got to go to acting camp and pretend like I\\'m an actor, and it was just as much fun as I think it is for the people who go to Space Camp, for the same reasons. In Friday\\'s episode, I have a line which is basically preparing for the OMS [orbital maneuvering system] burn and some technical callouts with Jody Balfour, who plays astronaut Ellen Wilson. She\\'s sitting in the pilot seat, I\\'m in the commander\\'s seat and we\\'re going through this procedure and I have to turn around and tell Molly Cobb [Walger] to put her seatbelt on.  And we shot that — but what you have to understand is that when you shoot a scene, even if is only to use a few seconds, it took the better part of an afternoon to get it done because you have to do it over and over again. You have to do it with the cameras in one position to get the wide shot and then bring the cameras in for close-ups and then the reaction shots. In the process, you have to take the set apart and pull out the payload bay for the close-up shots, and then you have to put it all back together again. So it takes the better part of the day for this one scene. So we are doing it over and over and the entire time we are doing it, Cobb is supposed to be in zero-g, so Sonya [Walger] is in a harness with wires holding her up and it is terribly uncomfortable. So she\\'s stuck there every time. Now, I\\'m proud to say that for the dozen times we shot that scene, I nailed my line every single time — expect once. And the one time I flubbed, Sonya was still up there in the wires, this was near the end of the day, and she looks at me, shakes her finger at me and says, \"You know Reisman? You have one damn line!\" And I just started cracking up, it was so funny. I said to her it was not my fault because who talks like this? Who wrote this? And because my line is a bunch of technobabble, it was lines that I wrote [as the technical consultant]. So I actually wrote the line. Related: A real-life astronaut taught Brad Pitt how to fly a spaceship for \\'Ad Astra\\'  cS: You mention the set, how close to the real shuttle flight deck was the mockup that you filmed in? Reisman: Our set was used for some other production, they didn\\'t build it just for the show. It looked pretty realistic. Let me put it to you this way: the switches were all in the right place. So if I needed to turn off GPC 1 [General Purpose Computer 1] I knew exactly where to reach for that switch. But the look and feel was a little bit different than the real thing. If you got up close and really looked at it, the main difference was that it was made out of plywood, so you could take it apart. Everything from behind the commander and pilot seats decoupled and separated into two pieces so you could shoot over the commander\\'s or pilot\\'s shoulders and then put it back together again. And not every window had glass in it, so you could shoot through the windows. And the seats, I don\\'t know where they got them, but they were quite different from the ones we used on the shuttle. But keep in mind this is an alternate universe, so who knows? cS: Is the flight suit you wore in the episode one of the flight suits you wore while at NASA or in space? Reisman: That\\'s a good question. I offered to bring my own and they told me no, because it might be slightly different from what the others were wearing. The more important thing was that it matched everybody else, not how authentic it was. So they said no. I did get a flight suit for one scene that was the standard blue flight suit like we had at NASA. I looked at the label and it was from the same manufacturer. I was even able to give them the size off of my actual flight suit and they went out and bought one from the very same company that makes the NASA flight suits. I think I did wear my own flight boots. That might have been my only contribution.  cS: What about the checklist you have in the scene. Was that something you had loaned to the production? Reisman: The checklist was not mine, but it was based on mine. At one point, Jaime Mengual, who is in charge of our props, he came down to my house and I brought out all my stuff from the attic. So I had all my checklists, my knee board, some space food and my flight suits. He looked at all of it and he took detailed photos. He even took the checklists and scanned them. So the checklist I was using was a prop, but it was based on a scan of my actual checklist. And if anybody wants to know the procedure I\\'m executing and reading from, it is actually an OMS [orbital maneuvering system] delta V [change in velocity] burn procedure from the shuttle OMS burns. cS: You mentioned earlier about the idea of putting your name on one of the show\\'s fictional mission patches and with this cameo, that happened. There is a space shuttle Columbia patch with your name on it. Did you have a hand in its design? Reisman: No, that was all done separately by graphic designer Evan Regester. I don\\'t even have one of my patches. I didn\\'t get to keep my costumes. I know you can buy it, so maybe I should get one myself. cS: This is your second cameo, not only on a show, but on one created by Ronald D. Moore. How did your \"For All Mankind\" experience differ from your walk-on role in the last episode of \"Battlestar Galactica\"? Reisman: \"Battlestar Galactica\" was an absolute spur-of-the-moment, impromptu thing. Ron invited me to visit the set while they were filming the last episode of the very last season and while I was there they asked, \"Hey, you want to be a colonial Marine?\" And so they sent me over the wardrobe and got me all kitted out and then I was in the back of a Raptor during a scene where the Raptor gets blown to smithereens. So my character didn\\'t last very long. I mean, it\\'s like a single frame. Now with \"For All Mankind,\" I have really come up in the world because in this episode on Friday, my official credit is actually \"guest star,\" which is another funny thing. My wife has been giving me a really hard time about it. She\\'s like, \"A guest star? So you\\'re like what, like Charo or Red Buttons on \"The Love Boat\"? I guess you have to be above a certain age to get that joke, but she teases me mercilessly about it. In reality, it\\'s very minor, I have one line, so it is very much tongue in cheek when I say I am a \"guest star.\" \"The Bleeding Edge,\" Episode 2 in Season 2 of \"For All Mankind,\" is available now on Apple TV+.

       "  'Title': \"'Harbor Seal Rock' on Mars and other new sights intrigue Perseverance rover scientists\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': ' NASA\\'s Perseverance rover has landed in a rich scientific hunting ground, if its first good look around is any guide. The car-sized Perseverance landed on the floor of Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, kicking off an ambitious surface mission that will hunt for signs of ancient Mars life and collect samples for future return to Earth, among other tasks. Perseverance is not yet ready to dive into that science work; the mission team is still conducting health and status checks on its various instruments and subsystems. But the six-wheeled robot recently used its Mastcam-Z camera suite to capture a high-definition, 360-degree panorama of its surroundings, and that first taste has the mission team intrigued. Live updates: NASA\\'s Perseverance Mars rover mission Join our forums here to discuss the Perseverance rover on Mars. What do you hope finds? For example, the zoomable panorama revealed a dark stone that the team has dubbed \"Harbor Seal Rock,\" Mastcam-Z principal investigator Jim Bell, of Arizona State University\\'s School of Earth and Space Exploration, said during a webcast discussion of the photo on Thursday (Feb. 25). The Martian wind probably carved Harbor Seal Rock into its curious shape over the eons, Bell said. He also pointed out patches that showed evidence of much faster-acting erosion — spots where the thrusters on Perseverance\\'s \"sky crane\" descent stage blew away Mars\\' blanket of red dust on Feb. 18, exposing the surfaces of small rocks. One such patch harbors a group of light-colored, heavily pitted stones that have caught mission scientists\\' eyes. \"Are these volcanic rocks? Are these carbonate rocks? Are these something else? Do they have coatings on them?\" Bell said. \"We don\\'t know — we don\\'t have any chemical data or mineral data on them yet — but, boy, they\\'re certainly interesting, and part of the story about what\\'s going on here is going to be told when we get more detailed information on these rocks and some of the other materials in this area.\" This is one of the key jobs of Mastcam-Z and Perseverance\\'s other cameras, Bell said — to spot interesting features that Perseverance can study in more detail with its spectrometers and other science instruments. The 28-mile-wide (45 kilometers) Jezero Crater harbored a deep lake and a river delta billions of years ago. Deltas are good at preserving signs of life here on Earth, so the Perseverance team is eager for the rover to study and sample the remnants of that feature within Jezero. And the delta is visible in the Mastcam-Z panorama; the cliffs that mark its edge are about 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) from Perseverance\\'s landing site, Bell said. The ridgeline that\\'s visible beyond the delta cliffs in the Mastcam-Z panorama is Jezero Crater\\'s rim, he added. The recently unveiled photo is just the beginning, of course. For starters, it\\'s the lowest-resolution panorama the Mastcam-Z team will construct. Bell said that similar shots that are three times sharper will be assembled after Perseverance switches over to its surface-optimized software, a four-day process that\\'s already underway. And we haven\\'t gotten the slightest taste of Perseverance\\'s science discoveries yet. That work will take a while to get going, because the mission team\\'s first big task after getting the rover up and running is to conduct test flights of the 4-lb. (1.8 kilograms) Mars Helicopter Ingenuity, which rode to the Red Planet on Perseverance\\'s belly. Ingenuity\\'s pioneering sorties — the first rotorcraft flights on a world beyond Earth — will likely take place this spring, and science and sampling are expected to begin in earnest in the summer, mission team members have said.

       "  'Title': 'Cosmologists create 4,000 virtual universes to solve Big Bang mystery',\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Cosmologists are pressing rewind on the first instant after the Big Bang by simulating 4,000 versions of the universe on a massive supercomputer. The goal is to paint a picture of the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang, when the observable universe suddenly expanded 1 trillion trillion times in size in the tiniest sliver of a microsecond. By applying the method used for the simulations to real observations of today\\'s universe, researchers hope to arrive at an accurate understanding of what this inflationary period looked like. \"We are trying to do something like guessing a baby photo of our universe from the latest picture,\" study leader Masato Shirasaki, a cosmologist at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), wrote in an email to Live Science. Today\\'s universe shows variations in density, with some patches rich in galaxies and others relatively barren. One promising hypothesis for this uneven distribution of visible matter is that, at the time of the Big Bang, there were already quantum fluctuations, or random, temporary changes in energy, in the tiny, primordial universe, Shirasaki said. When the universe expanded, these fluctuations would have expanded, too, with denser points stretching into regions of greater density than their surroundings. Gravitational forces would have interacted with these stretched-out filaments, causing galaxies to clump along them. But gravitational interactions are complex, so trying to rewind this inflationary period to understand how the universe would have looked before it is very challenging. Cosmologists essentially need to remove the gravitational fluctuations from the equation. The researchers developed a reconstruction method to do just that. To find out if the reconstruction was accurate, though, they needed some way to test it. So they used NAOJ\\'s ATERUI II supercomputer to create 4,000 versions of the universe, all with slightly different initial density fluctuations. The researchers allowed these virtual universes to undergo their own virtual inflations and then applied the reconstruction method to them, to see if it could get them back to their original starting points. — 7 far-out discoveries about the universe\\'s beginning — What is the Big Bang theory? — From Big Bang to present: Snapshots of our universe through time The results, published Jan. 4 in the journal Physical Review D, were promising. \"We find that a reconstruction method can reduce the gravitational effects on observed galaxy distributions, allowing us to extract the information of initial conditions of our universe in an efficient way,\" Shirasaki said. The reconstruction has been applied to real-world galaxy data before, he added, but the new study shows that it can work on the universe\\'s inflation period, too. The next step, Shirasaki said, is to apply the reconstruction to real observations of the cosmic web. Those observations have already been made by a telescope in New Mexico as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Originally published on Live Science',\n",

       "  'Title': \"Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin won't launch its 1st New Glenn rocket until late 2022\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'We\\'ll have to wait another year to see Blue Origin\\'s giant orbital rocket get off the ground. Blue Origin, which is run by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, announced today (Feb. 25) that it\\'s pushing the target date for the debut launch of its heavy-lift New Glenn rocket from late 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2022. \"This updated maiden flight target follows the recent Space Force decision to not select New Glenn for the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Phase 2 Launch Services Procurement (LSP),\" Blue Origin representatives wrote in an update today.\\n\\nRelated: NASA taps Blue Origin\\'s New Glenn to launch future missions Blue Origin and Northrop Grumman lost out to SpaceX and United Launch Alliance in that national-security launch decision, which the Space Force announced in August 2020. New Glenn is a two-stage rocket that stands 322 feet tall (98 meters) and is named after NASA astronaut John Glenn, who in February 1962 became the first American to circle Earth. (Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was the first person overall, pulling off the feat in April 1961.) The rocket will be capable of launching 50 tons (45 metric tons) to low Earth orbit when it\\'s up and running, according to its specifications page. Bezos has said he hopes New Glenn will fly people as well as payloads. Each New Glenn first stage will be capable of launching 25 missions, Blue Origins representatives say. Shortly after liftoff, the booster will come back to Earth and land on a ship at sea, as we\\'ve already seen the first stages of SpaceX\\'s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets do. Such reuse is key to Blue Origin\\'s overall vision, which involves helping humanity extend its footprint out into the final frontier. For example, the company\\'s New Shepard rocket-capsule combo, which is designed to take people and payloads to suborbital space, is fully reusable. One New Shepard vehicle has flown seven uncrewed test flights, acing its landing each time. (New Shepard is not yet operational, but its first crewed spaceflights could happen soon.) Blue Origin continues to make good progress on New Glenn and its launch pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, company representatives wrote in today\\'s update. The company has already scored New Glenn launch contracts with Eutelsat, Mu Space, OneWeb, Sky Perfect JSAT and Telesat, as Space News noted. And NASA recently made New Glenn eligible to compete for contracts under the agency\\'s Launch Services II program, which applies to launches through December 2027. \"New Glenn is proceeding to fulfill its current commercial contracts, pursue a large and growing commercial market, and enter into new civil space launch contracts,\" Blue Origin representatives wrote in today\\'s update. \"We hope to launch NSSL payloads in the future, and remain committed to serving the U.S. national defense mission.\" Mike Wall is the author of \"Out There\" (Grand Central Publishing, 2018; illustrated by Karl Tate), a book about the search for alien life.

       "  'Title': \"50 years ago, an Apollo 14 astronaut played golf on the moon. Here's the inside story.\",\n",
       "  'Full Article': 'Most golfers really want to avoid sand traps, but NASA astronaut Alan Shepard had no choice but to deal with one when wielding a six-iron head on the moon\\'s dusty surface 50 years ago this month. Shepard took a few moments during the Apollo 14 landing to show off his hobby during a live broadcast from the lunar surface on Feb. 6, 1971. He took two shots, with the second ball going \"miles and mile,\" he said on-camera. He was exaggerating, according to new analysis from the United States Golf Association (USGA). Based on data from the crew and a modern-day moon mission, the group found that the first ball traveled 24 yards (22 meters) and the second about 40 yards (37 m). By comparison, a 2019 report using golf tournaments\\' gender categories shows that an average amateur male golfer on Earth can drive the ball 216 yards (198 m), and an average female golfer 148 yards (135 m), although those distances have increased significantly since Shepard\\'s flight. Related: Apollo 14: NASA\\'s \\'rookie\\' astronauts bring golf to the moon (photos) To be fair to Shepard, however, he had more obstacles to contend with than your typical Sunday hobbyist. His golf \"club\" was actually a modified sample collection device with the head attached to the end. He was also wearing a notoriously stiff spacesuit that forced him to swing with a single arm. \"You can only get a one-handed shot, which really doesn\\'t give you the strength and speed of a normal golf shot on Earth,\" USGA historian Victoria Nenno told Space.com. \"You normally have a lot of turn [at the waist], and strength coming from legs. Unfortunately, Shepard was only able to manage a one-handed shot.\" In contrast, Nenno said, Earth-bound golfers have enjoyed technical advances like moisture-wicking technology in clothing, that Shepard would not have had access to in the 1970s, even on his home planet. For that reason, she added she was intrigued to hear of newer, more flexible moon spacesuits NASA is creating for the Artemis program for possible landings in 2024. \"It would be very interesting to see how that would affect the shot,\" Nenno said.  USGA found the lunar golf balls in high-resolution, enhanced scans of the original flight footage of the Apollo 14 mission. The association measured the point between divot and locations where the balls ended up using high-resolution images from orbit taken by NASA\\'s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which launched in 2009. The association used a second technique to confirm the measurements. Some of the images used were photo sequences taken from the lunar module, the astronauts\\' landing craft, taken to show the entire landing site to geologists on Earth. USGA stitched the photographs into a panorama to demonstrate the location of the divot and the two balls, which (after taking the new photo enhancements into account) were well within view of the landed spacecraft. The two balls are also visible in Apollo 14 takeoff footage, but only after applying \"a complex stacking technique on multiple separate frames,\" according to a USGA Golf Journal story. This means NASA astronauts Shepard and Ed Mitchell likely couldn\\'t have seen the balls themselves from the spacecraft, either during their time on the ground or when flying away from the moon. Happily for golf fans, Shepard found room to tuck away his modified club in the lunar module; that was lucky given that astronauts often discarded equipment on the moon to make room for precious rock samples. The rules surrounding giving space artifacts to astronauts were different in the 1970s, so Shepard kept the club before donating it to the USGA Museum in Liberty Corner, New Jersey, roughly an hour west of New York City, in 1974. Shepard was convinced to part with his precious moon club after the famed singer and entertainer Bing Crosby, a member of the USGA committee in 1972, wrote Shepard saying the museum would be \"an ideal repository for the celebrated implement,\" Nenno said. Shepard and Crosby were already acquainted from playing together at Pebble Beach, California, a well-known golf haven for enthusiasts. Nenno said the artifact is typically one of the most popular in the museum — not taking into account the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and associated quarantine rules, of course, which have affected tourist destinations worldwide. \"The Apollo program represented national pride and hope for the future. The artifact has a lot of those great feelings attached to it; the look of it is unusual and interesting compared to other golf equipment,\" she explained. Why \"unusual and interesting\"? Technically speaking, the golf club was a Wilson Staff Dyna-Power 6-iron head attached to a sampling tool — a five-piece tool loosely held together by string when not fully assembled — that was made of aluminum and Teflon. Golf clubs usually don\\'t come apart as Shepard\\'s moon club did, but Shepard needed the modification to fold it into the cramped quarters of the Apollo lunar lander. Shepard got the idea for his golf moonshot in 1970, when famed golfer Bob Hope visited NASA\\'s Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC, now Johnson Space Center) in Houston, the training hub for astronauts, for a television special. Hope took his golf club everywhere, according to the USGA, and Shepard was inspired to do a quick golf session on the moon to demonstrate the moon\\'s gravitational pull, which is one-sixth that of Earth, according to NASA. Shepard, the commander of Apollo 14 and a long-time NASA astronaut, used his connections to discreetly ask for help keeping the plan a surprise. Jack Harden, the pro at River Oaks Country Club in Houston, made the clubhead. NASA\\'s technical services division also assisted with the golf \"club\" construction, which had to meet the same strict safety requirements as other spacecraft payloads. Shepard also made sure to clear his golf shot with senior management, approaching then-MSC director Bob Gilruth to get buy-in. At first, Shepard recalled in a 1998 NASA oral history, Gilruth said \"there was absolutely no way.\" Shepard, however, explained the golf club\\'s construction to Gilruth and then made the director a promise.  \"The thing that finally convinced Bob was when I said, \\'Boss, I’ll make a deal with you. If we have screwed up, if we have had equipment failure, anything has gone wrong on the surface where you are embarrassed or we are embarrassed, I will not do it. I will not be so frivolous,\\'\" said Shepard at the time. \"I want to wait until the very end of the mission, stand in front of the television camera, whack these golf balls with this makeshift club, fold it up, stick it in my pocket, climb up the ladder, and close the door, and we’ve gone,\" Shepard said. \"So he finally said, \\'Okay.\\' And that’s the way it happened.\" Like any good astronaut, Shepard simulated his golf shot long before making it to the moon. He would regularly haul his more than 200-lb. (90 kilograms) spacesuit to a local bunker to practice his shot while suited up, away from the public eye, just to make sure he could land it, USGA said. Decades after the historic golf excursion, Shepard still had pride in the accomplishment. \"So far I\\'m the only person to have hit a golf ball on the moon. Probably will be for some time,\" he told NASA in the February 1998 oral history, a few months before his death at age 74. He marveled at how different an experience was golfing on the lunar surface. \"What a neat place to whack a golf ball.\" Follow Elizabeth Howell on Twitter @howellspace.

The vehicle will fly about 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) into the South Texas skies, a high-altitude jaunt similar to the ones flown by the three-engine SN8 and SN9 prototypes on Dec. 9 and Feb. 2, respectively. Those two flights went well until the very end. Both SN8 and SN9 hit their targeted landing zones but did not survive the touchdown, exploding in massive fireballs. SpaceX is developing Starship to get people and cargo to the moon, Mars and beyond. The system consists of two fully reusable elements: a 165-foot-tall (50 meters) spacecraft called Starship and a huge rocket known as Super Heavy. The final Starship will have six Raptors, and Super Heavy will be powered by about 30 of the engines, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has said. The final, operational Starship could be flying soon, if all goes according to plan. SpaceX hopes to launch a prototype into orbit sometime this year, and Musk recently said he thinks the system will be flying people regularly by 2023.
